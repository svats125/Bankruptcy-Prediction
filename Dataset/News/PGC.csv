But despite the continued rally, a few analysts appear to have concerns.  According to the Moneycontrol Analyst Tracker as of February 1, the number of analysts tracking the stock has fallen from 23 to 21. &lsquo;Buy&rsquo; calls on Power Grid stock have fallen sharply, from 19 to 12, &lsquo;sell&rsquo; calls have remained at 4, while &lsquo;hold&rsquo; calls have increased from zero to 4. The average 12-month target price is Rs 231.53.

At Rs 11,819.70 crore, the consolidated revenue for the same period saw a marginal gain, up from Rs 11,530.22 crore in the previous fiscal. On February 3, a day after announcing the Q3FY23-24 results, the stock closed 3 percent higher.  Limited growth opportunities driving downgrades  In January 2024, Investec said in a report that along with growth challenges, the stock is at risk of increased competition in tariff-based competitive bidding (TBCB). Nuvama Institutional Equities, which has a `hold&rsquo; call on the stock, said in a November 2023 note that the company&rsquo;s PAT growth is likely to be less than 5 percent over FY24-265E, due to a high base. Further, the company faces a long gestation period between winning TBCB bids (FY 2024-25), constructing them (FY 2025-26), and commissioning them by FY27.  Also read:&nbsp;Power Grid Q3 net profit inches up 10.5% to Rs 4,028.25 crore, beats estimates  What makes Power Grid a stock to &lsquo;Buy&rsquo;  Despite the downgrades and slow growth, a majority of analysts tracking the stock continue to be optimistic. In January 2024, a Jefferies report said that smart metering and asset monetisation could continue to positively influence the stock.  While a few brokerages have previously raised concerns on capex, BoB Capital said in a report in November 2023 that the &ldquo;mega Rs 1.9 trillion capex pipeline over FY2024-32 is likely to invigorate the asset base, and hence valuations.&rdquo; This capex pipeline includes Rs 1.7 trillion for transmission infrastructure. The long-term transmission capex target looks plausible, given the government&rsquo;s renewable energy target of 500 GW by 2030, according to analysts.  In November 2023, it was reported by IIFL Securities that by 2032, Power Grid &ldquo;plans to invest Rs 1.16 lakh crore in inter-state transmission projects, Rs 37,000 crore in intra-state transmission projects, Rs 10,000 crore in cross-border commerce, and Rs 7,500 crore in foreign activities.&rdquo;  In a post earnings report, CLSA gave the stock an &lsquo;Outperform&rsquo; rating and raised the target price to Rs 285. It said that the key message from the result was that it has gained market share in new bids in a much bigger market.

Capacity woes, high costs may mean a missed market for the PSU.","Power Grid Corp of India is expected to record a modest on-year growth in Q3 revenue on slow capacity build-up, while its net profit may fall because of a rise in transmission costs. The company is set to announce its Q3 FY24 results on February 7.  The PSU power transmission company is expected to see its fiscal third quarter revenue grow 2 percent on-year to Rs 11,811 crore, according to an average of three brokerage estimates. Net profit is expected to fall 0.9 percent to Rs 3,612 crore, according to estimates.  Earlier, in Q2FY24, state-run&nbsp;power transmission firm reported a 4 percent on-year increase in net profit to Rs 3,781.42 crore, while its total income for the same period grew 1.6 percent on-year to Rs 11,530 crore.  Power generation buoyant in Q3, but capacity shortage may have hit Power Grid  According to brokerages, power generation remained buoyant in Q3FY24 on the back of surging demand during the festive season. &ldquo;Rising power demand, widening peak deficit, incremental renewables addition, the requirement to add incremental thermal capacity (as peak shortages increase) and expansion into new ventures (pumped storage and green hydrogen) are some key drivers for the sector, an Elara Securities report said.  Power Grid has 12 &lsquo;buy&rsquo; calls against five &lsquo;sell&rsquo; and four &lsquo;hold&rsquo; calls at present. Analysts at Elara Securities said in a recent note that India&rsquo;s transmission capex is progressing at a slower pace. Further, private sector participation in transmission is higher, adding to the competition.  &ldquo;Power Grid Corporation's (PGCIL) work-in-hand has remained stagnant at Rs 500,000 crore since FY2020 and much lower than the peak in FY2016. While work in hand may grow, project conceptualisation, award and conversion to earnings may take a long time,&rdquo; said the note.

JM Financial has a buy call with a target price of Rs 235.  In a November 2023, Q2 earnings report, Elara analysts maintained a &lsquo;reduce&rsquo; call on the stock as they saw limited earnings growth due to low capex and capitalization.

This makes us optimistic of pick-up in Power Grid&rsquo;s capex/asset capitalization.

On a YoY basis, 9MFY23 commissioning at the consolidated level stood at ~Rs52bn as against Rs185bn in 9MFY22. Earnings growth for the company is expected to considerably moderate for FY24/FY25, owing to commissioning of ~Rs100bn each in FY23 and FY24 at consolidated level. Over the medium term, Power Grid is expected to register ~5% EPS CAGR, with dividend yield of ~7%. Power Grid remains as a low risk, moderate-return profile utility, in our view. Outlook We maintain BUY on the stock, with Dec-24 TP of Rs250/share. Over the past 5 years, the average P/B for the stock has been ~1.7x, with RoE of 17-18%. At CMP of Rs213/share, the stock trades at ~1.7x. The stock provides dividend yield of ~7% presently.

The company is set to declare its results on November 4 for the quarter ended September 2022.  According to a poll of brokerages conducted by Moneycontrol.com, PAT for the utility major is expected to be around Rs 3,720 crore, while consolidated revenues for the quarter are seen growing to Rs 10,930 crore.  On a sequential basis, both the consolidated PAT as well as revenues are likely to remain flat.    Brokerage views  ICICI Securities  The brokerage pegs the total income from operations for the quarter at Rs 10,965 crore with a YoY growth of 7 percent. The operating income is likely to remain flat compared to the previous quarter of the current fiscal.  The growth in income compared to last year is likely to be driven by a 7.5 percent on-year growth in Transmission income to Rs 10,805 crore and a 16 percent on-year growth in income from Consultancy activities to Rs 2,200 crore.  The operating expenses are seen increasing by 12.4 percent on-year to Rs 1,300 crore due to ~4 percent jump in employee costs and a 20 percent surge in other operating expenses. On a sequential basis however, the expenses are likely to decline by ~21 percent.  This will result in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of Rs 9,666 crore, a YoY growth of 6 percent, and a sequential growth of 4.5 percent.  The EBITDA margin at 88.1 percent is flat on-year, but likely to improve by 330 bps from the previous quarter.  &ldquo;We expect Power Grid&rsquo;s Q2FY23 consolidated recurring PAT to increase 10.1 percent YoY on the back of Rs 11,000 crore trailing twelve months (TTM) capitalisation, resulting in 6.1 percent YoY increase in EBITDA and 6.8 percent YoY rise in revenues,&rdquo; said a report from the brokerage firm ICICI Securities.  According to the brokerage, the key factors to watch out for include capex and capitalisation during the quarter (Q2FY23), upcoming opportunities in the transmission space, especially in tariff-based competitive bidding (TBCB) projects, and update on diversification into smart metering, green businesses and data centre.  Kotak Institutional Equities  The brokerage estimates revenues of Rs 11,117 crore on account of asset capitalisation of Rs 16,400 crore in TTM.  The EBITDA margin at 85.5 is seen declining by 287 bps on-year and remaining flat on-quarter.  &ldquo;We factor in asset capitalisation of Rs 2,200 crore in Q2FY23 compared to capitalisation of Rs 1,340 crore achieved in Q1FY23, while sequential decline in profits should be seen in the context of lower effective tax rate of 12 percent in Q1FY23,&rdquo; said the brokerage in its note.  It forecasts a PAT of Rs 3,520 crore, a YoY growth of 5.3 percent, but a sequential decline of 6 percent.  Antique Stock Broking  The brokerage anticipates consolidated revenues for the quarter to grow 5 percent on-year and remain flat sequentially at Rs 10,426 crore, and EBITDA remaining flat at Rs 8,785 crore.  The PAT at Rs 3,759 crore is higher by 13 percent on-year. However, it is likely to remain flat on-quarter.  The company had indicated that it has plans to foray into the smart metering infra business, where it will invest in smart meter asset development business as floated by the respective state utilities. Power Grid aspires to be present across the value chain, wherein the company will set up the required infrastructure and manage the operations and maintenance business as well as those that will aid revenue growth in the coming quarter, the brokerage said in its report.  Power Grid was ended&nbsp;Rs 1.90 lower at Rs 226.15&nbsp;on November 4 at the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The stock has generated returns of 22 percent over the past one year. Over the last one month, it has gained 8.5 percent.

Exploring non-transmission opportunities (has set-up PowerGrid Energy Services) in power sector like energy management, smart meters, smart grid, energy storage would diversify earnings stream and create value in the long term. Asset monetization target of Rs. 6,600 crore for FY23 and no REC takeover plan would mean sustained high dividend payout of ~60% (based on FY22) and dividend yield of 6-7%. Outlook Media reports indicate that the Power ministry has recently rejected the proposal for REC&rsquo;s takeover by Power Grid. This removes overhang of investment in unrelated business and focus shifts to Power Grid&rsquo;s strong earnings visibility given regulated RoE model. We maintain Buy on Power Grid with an unchanged PT of Rs. 265 as stock price correction of 15% from 52-week high and attractive valuation of 1.6x FY24E P/BV provides investment opportunity.
