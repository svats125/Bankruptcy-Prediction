Kumar said the government is working on reducing the consumption of non-biodegradable plastics, and re-using and re-cycling of other graded polymers. The government has instituted awards for Green Technology in plastic processing, to promote environment friendly efforts in the industry, he added.","Ananth Kumar, Business, Consultative Committee of Parliament, Fertiliser Minister, Green Technology, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, Indian Oil Corporation, investment, Nagarjuna Oil Refinery, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, petrochemical, PTI",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/petrochemical-regions-attract-investmentrs-106-lakh-cr_1352178.html
