The company's board had approved a Rs 4,000-crore share buyback in January, the record date for which was on February 28.  At 11.18 am, shares of Bajaj Auto were trading at Rs 7,982.15 on the NSE.  The company&nbsp;had announced buyback 40 lakh shares, or 1.4 percent stake, at a price of Rs 10,000 per share. The floor price of the buyback sits at a premium of 18 percent to the current market price.&nbsp;The buyback&nbsp;will happen through the tender offer route.  Follow our market blog for all the live action  However, given the smaller size of buyback and higher retail shares, acceptance ratio is expected to be lower. As per analysts at Nuvama, the acceptance ratio could come in the range of 4-10 percent. Those with investments of up to Rs 2 lakh are treated as retail investors.  The buyback is likely to be completed within the next 15 days.  This also marks Bajaj Auto's second share buyback in&nbsp;two&nbsp;years. Previously, the two-wheeler company repurchased shares worth Rs 2,500 crore from stakeholders&nbsp;at Rs 4,600 per share. Meanwhile, the company is also on the path to&nbsp;end FY24 with a cash balance of Rs 20,000 crore, providing it the headroom to reward investors and stage the buyback.  Shares of the two-wheeler company have more than doubled in the past year, even hitting an all-time high of Rs 8,650 this month.

The firm said that the two-wheeler segment of the company is poised for a rebound, anticipating a 15 percent volume CAGR in FY24-26.

Robust Q3 results  During the fiscal third quarter, the Triumph-maker reported a 37 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in net profit for the third quarter Rs 2,041.88 crore driven by robust sales of its two-wheelers, price hikes and higher realisations amid consistent demand.

In comparison, the turnover during Q3FY23 amounted to Rs 9,315 crore.  Bajaj Auto stated that its margin increased further to 20.1 percent, up by +100 bps YoY.

We also expect a strong traction coming from new launches which would drive overall demand. &amp;amp;gt;125cc segment has provided new identity to BAL. Solid performance of premium Pulsar models, KTM bikes and Triumph models this year should all provide the required fillip to both volumes and margins. On the exports front, markets like Africa is seeing recovery while Latam is stable. ASEAN markets are facing temporary lull and are expected to rise in coming quarters. Brazil is providing a new stream of volumes for BAL. With 2W Chetak expanding its coverage and fetching good response, we believe Chetak to add to the numbers substantially in H2 of FY24. The withdrawal of FAME subsidy remains a concern for the EV 2Ws, but we believe it to impact BAL little. 3W performance was robust in Q1, touching new highs, on CNG success. EV 3W launch should further aid the business. Neutral RM and currency price movement , price hikes planned and prudent cost management should assist margins in the ensuing quarters.

EBITDA margins saw slight decline QoQ on de-inventorisation, inferior mix and better vehicle mix, offset by higher operating leverage. However, strong cost control of employee expenses and other operating expense, shielded from a steeper decline. Export volumes recovered QoQ and BJAUT is expecting gradual improvement, given macro challenges in those markets. The company will also face increasing pressure from inferior mix as the export portfolio from African regions begins to increase (higher mix of low margin products) plus increase in EV volumes and margins are likely to remain at current levels. 2Q volumes in domestic market could be soft due to high base. Outlook We expect BJAUT&rsquo;s domestic premium segment volumes to grow (similar to the industry) helped by premiumisation trends besides fast ramp-up of EVs could make us turn constructive on the stock.

The company is evaluating how to address this subsidy cut in vehicle pricing.","The Central Government's decision to slash FAME subsidy for electric two wheelers will definitely retard the growth of the electric vehicle industry. Speaking exclusively to CNBC-TV18, Rakesh Sharma the Executive Director of Bajaj Auto said, &amp;quot;The announcement on subsidy reduction has been abrupt, and we will see a shock for over two to three months&amp;quot;.  Sharma said that for Bajaj Auto, the restructuring of FAME will lead to a Rs 20,000 reduction in subsidy per scooter. The company is evaluating how to address this subsidy cut in vehicle pricing.  With the 2,000 crore allocation for electric two wheelers drawing to a close, the government has decided to allocate an additional 1,500 crores for electric two wheelers for FY24. But the increased allocation has come at a price.  In order to extend the FAME scheme till March'24, the government has reduced subsidy per scooter from 40 percent of vehicle cost to 15 percent of the vehicle cost. Several electric two wheeler makers had opposed the move and are likely to announce price hikes in the coming days.  &amp;quot;There are enough signals from the government that the FAME scheme is on its last legs. Therefore tempering down of incentives, which lead to tempering of growth rates are steps in the right direction. Breakneck growth in EV sales, with ambiguity skews decision making regarding capital investments. Many customers coming into the consumption cycle who are not strong enough to buy the products. This lead to dissatisfaction later as subsidies are not sustainable&amp;quot;, said Sharma to CNBC-TV18.  The senior executive of Bajaj Auto said that the slowdown in growth will be seen for a few month after 1st June, 2023, when the new FAME structure comes into effect. After the first few months, we will see EV sales growing at a saner level, he said.  Bajaj Auto is looking to ramp up electric two wheeler production to 10,000 units per month in H1 and gradually take it to 15,000 units per month in the second half of the year. Sharma said that the electric vehicle industry will see consolidation in FY24, with some of the weaker players looking to sell a minority stake or exit the market.","Bajaj Auto, Business, Companies, Rakesh Sharma",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/enough-signalsgovernment-that-fame-islast-legs-says-bajaj-auto39s-rakesh-sharma_17032021.html
