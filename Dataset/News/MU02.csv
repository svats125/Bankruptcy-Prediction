The court has scheduled the afternoon session to declare the quantum of sentence for the convicted workers.,"A highly-guarded district court in Gurugram on Friday convicted 31 plant workers and acquitted 117 others in the Maruti violence case of 2012 which injured over 100 employees and killed a senior officer. &amp;amp;nbsp; Additional District and Sessions Judge of Gurugram District Court delivered the verdict. The court has scheduled the afternoon session to declare the quantum of sentence for the convicted workers. &amp;amp;nbsp; General Manager Human Resources of the Manesar unit, Awanish Kumar Dev, was charred to death beyond recognition and several other executives were injured in a violent clash between the workers and the management on the plant premises on July 18, 2012. &amp;amp;nbsp; Immediately after the clash, around 546 workers were laid off and 147 were arrested, out of whom 145 were charged with rioting, murder, attempt to murder, unlawful assembly, assault, and trespass among other sections of the penal code. &amp;amp;nbsp; The case trial has been going on for the last five years. Senior advocates like RS Cheema, Rebecca John and Vrinda Grover appeared on behalf of the accused employees in the case. The counsels had submitted that the case lacked the support of proper evidence to convict the accused ones. &amp;amp;nbsp; They had stated that there was no evidence to back the allegation that the workers had unlawfully assembled with a common objective to kill or set the office on fire. They had also argued there were loopholes in the investigation which suggested the accused were being falsely implicated as there was no evidence to back the claim of the prosecution. &amp;amp;nbsp; During the final arguments, the prosecution had submitted that the court should in no way show mercy to the accused as it led to large scale vandalism in the company and killed a senior official. &amp;amp;nbsp; Out of the total accused in the case, 138 were out on bail. During a course of arguments, Vrinda Grover had submitted that almost 112 of the accused were not identified by any of the prosecution witness. &amp;amp;nbsp; The district administration has deployed heavy security at Maruti's Manesar plant ahead of court verdict. Prohibitory orders have been imposed under Section 144 of the CrPC around the plant and the district courts complex. &amp;amp;nbsp; An official statement issued by the Maruti Suzuki Workers Union hinted at a possible protest if the court verdict was not in their favour. &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;We are apprehensive and have grounds to believe that it will be a politically motivated anti-worker judgment. We will stand by those facing conviction or were left jobless after the incident,&amp;quot; read an official. &amp;amp;nbsp; In 2011, Maruti incurred a loss over 0 million worth of production due the continuous weeks of labour unrest. This violence had also created a dent on India's appeal as an investor friendly location. &amp;amp;nbsp; It is interesting to note that when the violence broke out, almost half of the workers in the Manesar plant were on contract basis earning around Rs 6,000 per month, a one third of what permanent employees were paid for.","Awanish Kumar Dev, Business, Gurugram, Vrinda Grover",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/gurugram-court-convicts-31acquits-117maruti-violence-case_8628261.html

The long-awaited debut of Toyota-owned luxury brand Lexus will also likely happen later this month.","Swaraj BaggonkarMoneycontrol NewsFrom a five-door, five-seater mini car to a twin-seater, two-door exotic super sports car, March is seeing a power packedline up of new launches. To serve the taste buds of car enthusiasts as many as seven new launches are scheduled this month. With an average of nearly two introductions every week, the launches come from Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Honda, Renault, Nissan and Lamborghini. The long-awaited debut of Toyota-owned luxury brand Lexus will also likely happen later this month. The rush for new launches comes on the back of a steady rise in consumer interest for cars who have flocked back to showrooms starting January having stayed away from purchases in November and December following demonetisation. The country&amp;amp;rsquo;s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki was first off the block with the launch of the Baleno RS, a souped-up variant of the Baleno, its most popular premium hatchback. The Baleno RS gets 1.0 litre boosterjet turbo engine (101bhp) as against the usual 1.2 litre (84bhp). The car comes with SmartPlay infotainment system with Apple CarPlay.After the successful launch the Tiago Mumbai-based Tata Motors is keen to replicate that achievement with the upcoming Tigor. A compact sedan is based on the same platform as the Tiago; the Tigor will fight against Maruti Swift Dzire, Hyundai Xcent and Honda Amaze. The Tigor boasts of a coupe-like rear which will become a stand-out feature in the crowd. Not far behind is an all-new product from Honda. The Japanese giant will launch the WR-V, a premium crossover on the lines of the Hyundai i20 Elite, Fiat Avventura and Toyota Etios Cross. Its tall body design may even allow it to compete against compact sports utility vehicles such as Maruti Suzuki Brezza and Ford EcoSport. Slated for launch on March 16, the WR-V is the first model developed by Honda R&amp;amp;amp;D India in association with Honda R&amp;amp;amp;D Co, Japan. Bookings for the crossover, which is based on the Jazz platform, has already begun with Rs 21,000. For those who are slightly tight on budget there is the Renault Kwid Climber, a jazzed-up version of the Kwid, one of the highest selling budget car models in India. The Climber is priced at Rs 4.3 lakh and is also available with an automated manual transmission version priced at Rs 4.6 lakh. Powered by a 1 litre engine the Kwid Climber, which will come with distinct-looking alloy wheels, roof rails and whitish interiors, will sit high above the ground in an SUV-like demeanour ready for off-roading. Toyota-owned luxury brand Lexus will finally set foot in India this month with reportedly two SUVs and a sedan that are likely to be priced upwards of Rs 70 lakhs going up to Rs 2.2 crore. Such pricing puts them in direct competition with models of Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Porsche and Jaguar Land Rover. Toyota will initially fully import Lexus models before taking a call on local assembly, as per reports. The luxury brand will have their own line of high-end, limited-number dealerships. However, the star amongst them all would be the Italian race horse from Lamborghini. The super sports car Aventador S has been launched in India and is available for a jaw-dropping Rs 5.01 crore. This car, which generates a staggering 740hp of power (more than 16 times more powerful than India&amp;amp;rsquo;s largest selling car Maruti Suzuki Alto), is the second launch by Lamborghini this year. The Italian great had launched the Hurracan RWD Spyder, an open-top car (convertible) earlier last month at Rs 3.45 crore.","automotive, Business, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/hot-wheelsmaruti-tata-motors-to-set-roads-ablaze-this-mar_8625201.html
