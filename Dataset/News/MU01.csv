Such valuation offers up to ~50%/45% upside risk to our MSIL TP/CMP (Exhibit 1) based on various scenarios for valuations (upper/lower band) and discounts (at par or at 20% discount to Hyundai). We believe MSIL could trade at similar valuations as Hyundai, amid Suzuki&rsquo;s large India dependence and Toyota&rsquo;s support/alliance, offset by Hyundai&rsquo;s strong global standing and premium positioning.   Outlook Potential small-car recovery (akin to commuter motorcycles) and MSIL&rsquo;s E-SUV launch in ~Oct-24 (industry&rsquo;s firstborn EV launch) are added upside risks.

MSIL undertook massive inventory correction with wholesales being 115k unit lower than retail, bringing down dealer inventory level to 45k units at end of Q3. Higher traction for CNG cars (along with improving supplies) and higher SUV sales should help MSIL grow faster than the industry which is expected to grow at low to mid single digit in FY25 (on a high base).

Speaking at an event here, the veteran industry leader noted that the central government over the last nine years has been bringing in a series of reforms and improvements in the business environment.  He noted that the country has seen massive improvement in the rankings when it comes to the ease of doing business.  Besides, the government has also abolished over 1,000 old acts while initiating a lot of reforms in taxation as well, Bhargava said.  &amp;quot;All designed to make it easier to do business in India, and to be more competitive in manufacturing. Unfortunately, the results are not yet apparent,&amp;quot; Bhargava said.  He noted that the bulk of the interaction of manufacturers and entrepreneurs is with the state government officials.  &amp;quot;And in the state governments, the bureaucracy and the entire administration has still not changed the way the central government has changed,&amp;quot; Bhargava said.  He further said: &amp;quot;And there are lots of delays. Time is not a factor which is valued highly by most people in the states. And the attitude of administration is very much similar to what it used to be in the licence and control days, that the job of the bureaucracy the job of the civil servant is to control rather than facilitate.  Besides, the entrepreneurs are also largely maintaining the mindset and practices which were developed during the licences and control period because in those days the private sector was not in a position to grow in any way or innovate because the licence laid down every condition of their functioning, Bhargava said.  &amp;quot;Now, that resulted in various malpractices developing.. you're all aware of the growth of black money in the country. We are all aware of what black money growth means in terms of ostentatious consumption,&amp;quot; he added.  He further said: &amp;quot;So as long as the system continues where entrepreneurs, businessmen are more concerned about showing off their personal wealth and generating personal incomes and are not so much focused on growing their companies. I'm afraid the growth rates will not work..  Citing the example of Maruti Suzuki, Bhargava said the company grew at a time when all the conditions were unfavourable.  He noted that despite improvement in the ease of doing business in the country, the growth of the manufacturing sector is still about 5 per cent a year.  &amp;quot;We need to get up to 12 per cent a year. That's the kind of change which is needed and it cannot happen unless everybody involved in this business, whether it's people who are vendors, people who are dealers, people who are entrepreneurs, people who are large industrialists, they all decide that our first priority is to grow our companies not our personal wealth,&amp;quot; Bhargava said.  He noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pointed out in 2014 that if the country wanted to solve major issues like poverty and unemployment in the country the manufacturing sector has to grow at a higher rate.  &amp;quot;If we are going to have greater equity in our society, all of this would only be possible if the manufacturing sector grows faster, and we reach at least 25 per cent of the GDP through the manufacturing sector,&amp;quot; Bhargava said.  On the domestic car industry, he noted that India is now the biggest growing market in the world.  There is no other country in the world of any size, which has the potential for growth in the car market, which India has, he noted.  Whether it is the US, Europe, Japan or China, all these countries have now become saturated, Bhargava said.  &amp;quot;India is the only country which still has a lot of distance to go before the market becomes saturated. And it is for this reason that in the last 15-20 years, almost every car manufacturer in the world has found his way into India, and those who haven't come are still looking to come now,&amp;quot; he stated.  So the Indian car market is going to be a growing car market and equally it is going to be a highly competitive car market, he noted.  Companies have to work to bring the best of technologies, the best products, the greatest reliability in the products, and the best of after-sales service, Bhargava said.  &amp;quot;That's what Maruti has been trying to do all these 40 years. That is what we will continue to do. And we will continue to see that we make our best efforts to keep a large part of the market under our control,&amp;quot; he added.  On the company's plans to introduce electric cars, Bhargava said the company plans to bring in six models over the next few years in order to keep its market share intact.  &amp;quot;If we are to keep 45-50 per cent of that market. You can't do it by having one or two models. You need to have a large number of models..six models we feel is the minimum that we require.  He further said: &amp;quot;Even with six models, we think that by 2030 only about 15-20 per cent of our sales will be electric vehicles.  Maruti Suzuki plans to launch its first battery-electric vehicle by 2025.  Bhargava said the company was first trying to convert WagonR into an electric car..  The conversion happened but the company realised that the cost of the car was coming out to be so high that it would not be a viable proposition, he added.  &amp;quot;And that is why we gave it up and said that now let's look at developing a bigger model because the lower car segment is not such as could be converted to electric operations and still remain within the affordability region for customers of that car,&amp;quot; Bhargava said.  By the time the company enters the electric segment there would be the possibility of reasonable volume being sold in the market, he said.","Business, Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/officialsstates-continue-to-function-like-licence-raj-days-says-maruti-suzuki-chairman-rc-bhargava_17251971.html

No other nation has taken the opportunity like India did to showcase its development, raise the profile of the country and also to use the G20 platform to make a lot of changes, and improvements in attitudinal differences in different parts of the country under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Bhargava told PTI.  At a time when the world is facing a number of problems both economically and politically such as the Ukraine-Russia war, inflation, global warming and carbon footprint being everybody's concern, India has taken the lead in trying to move the countries of the world towards recognising how they can deal with these problems, he added.  &amp;quot;On all these issues, India has taken a considerable lead over anybody else in trying to move the countries of the world towards recognising how they can deal with these problems and I think that opportunity has been strengthened by the fact that compared to most of the countries, including those in the G20, India has been very stable politically and its economy has done better than any other country,&amp;quot; he reasoned.  Further, Bhargava said, &amp;quot;We have the fastest growing economy today compared to the US, and China and all have been left behind. So I think that is really where we have even greater credibility in our efforts to influence the world because we are not speaking from a position of weakness.  &amp;quot;We are speaking from a position of some strength, strength caused by the ability to act...because it's one thing for your own to be in some sort of disarray and then you're telling everybody else to put things in order. It is another thing when your home is shining and then you tell others these are some of the things you can do.  &amp;quot;India's position to make an &amp;quot;impact on some of these major global issues, on the countries of the world is much, much better than it ever has been&amp;quot;, he asserted.  On the road ahead for G20, Bhargava said, &amp;quot;Brazil and whoever succeeds after that will be inspired by what has been done in India and will carry forward the kind of momentum which had been built for G20.&amp;quot;  It should not again become less important to the world in the future, he said, adding, &amp;quot;We have raised the stature of G20, we have raised the importance of G20. The G20 has been given a certain recognition of its ability to influence people in the world. I think that Brazil should carry it forward...I'm sure they will do their best.&amp;quot;  Reflecting on how India has been able to use the G20 platform to showcase itself and promote different parts of the countries, Bhargava said, &amp;quot;(while the G20 presidency rotates)...I have not ever seen any country take the kind of opportunity G20 apparently was offering but which only Mr Modi seems to recognise.&amp;quot;  He added the prime minister recognised that &amp;quot;G20 has certain opportunities for countries like India, at least to showcase its own development, to exhibit what is happening in this country, to raise the profile of the country and also to use the G20 to make a lot of changes and improvements and attitudinal differences in different parts of the country. Giving the example of the way subcommittees of the G20 were organised in different parts of the country and what it led to, Bhargava said, &amp;quot;I think it's quite remarkable that we took this kind of advantage of our presidency of G20 to completely raise the profile of the conference and what the conference would do for a country like ours.&amp;quot;","Business, Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/india-raised-statureg20-gave-recognition-to-its-ability-to-influence-peoplethe-world-rc-bhargava_17229541.html

Maruti intends to bank on its existing cash reserves of Rs 45,000 crore to hit a cumulative production of 4 million cars by fiscal 2030-31, the company stated at its AGM.  India's leading car manufacturer, by sales, also projects its export volumes to touch 800,000 cars by fiscal 2031, Maruti Suzuki Chairman RC Bhargava stated during the meeting.&nbsp;The automaker&nbsp;has exported 259,333 cars, as of fiscal 2023.  The company chairman, early this August, said that Maruti will set up a manufacturing unit in Haryana to&nbsp;manufacture 1 million cars annually, and is already on the lookout for a site for the next factory.  Acquisition of Suzuki Motor's Gujarat facility  Earlier this month, Maruti Suzuki announced that it plans to acquire the company's Japanese parent Suzuki Motor's Gujarat facility, in order to&nbsp;align its production scale and capacity, including that of electric vehicles.  Foray into EV segment  Addressing shareholders' concerns about the automaker making it late to the electric vehicle (EV) segment, Bhargava said that Maruti is working to bring about the transition. &amp;quot;While Maruti is behind in launching EVs, it doesn&rsquo;t damage our ability to acquire adequate market share,&rdquo; he stated.  The car manufacturer's first EV will&nbsp;hit the roads around 2024-25, followed by a slew of six EV models by 2030-31, which will be manufactured at&nbsp;the Gujarat unit.  Vision 2031  Maruti Suzuki has been on an aggressive expansion phase, its third, technically, and is aimed at boosting its production capacity by an additional 2 million cars over the next eight years, stated Bhargava. He also highlighted the company's vision to more than double revenue during this period - a trajectory which stands in stark contrast to the 40-year period it took to achieve a similar production volume.  Speaking at the AGM, Bhargava also stated that a rapid growth projectile necessitates reorganization of the company, owing to which the acquisition&nbsp;of the Gujarat facility is a crucial step.&nbsp;The chairman further noted that the car&nbsp;manufacturer will equally focus on cementing its foothold in the&nbsp;SUV market&nbsp;to boost the company's bottom line.  Earlier this July, the automaker reported reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on solid orders. It also predicted a rise in its average selling prices in the upcoming quarters.","Business, Companies, Maruti Suzuki India",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/maruti-suzuki-aiming-to-double-production-capacity-by-2031_17222231.html

The board has also approved the termination of the contract manufacturing agreement with SMG.  The equity deal once complete will make SMG a wholly-owned subsidiary of Maruti Suzuki India.  The company's board, in its meeting held on the same day, evaluated two options for acquiring the SMC equity in SMG. The board discussed payment in cash or issue of MSI shares on a preferential allotment basis.  &ldquo;The impact of both options on the profitability of MSI, the earnings per share and the dividend payment to shareholders was considered for each year up to 2031.
