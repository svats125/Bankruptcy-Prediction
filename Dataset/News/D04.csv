Within financials, large private sector banks benefitted from healthy loan demand even as the rising cost of funds weighed on their profitability. A contrasting trend was seen in consumer staples, where declining raw material inflation was offset by anemic volume growth, especially in the rural markets.  IT companies expectedly delivered weak numbers due to macroeconomic headwinds in the US and Europe, their biggest markets. The slowdown in discretionary spending and delays in deal conversions are expected to persist this year, according to analysts.  Also Read:&nbsp;For Indian IT, 2023 was one of the worst years since Global Financial Crisis  Hits and misses  &ldquo;The 3QFY24 corporate earnings scorecard has been in line so far, with heavyweights such as HDFC Bank, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank, JSW Steel, and Reliance Industries driving the aggregate. The earnings spread has been decent, with 64 percent of our coverage universe either meeting or exceeding profit expectations. However, growth has primarily been led by the BFSI, metals, oil and gas, and auto sectors,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said in a recent note.  Global brokerage firm Jefferies noted that earnings upgrades were substantially more than downgrades.  Meaningful EPS upgrades were seen in energy public sector units, cement and pharma (generics), while notable cuts were seen in select companies such as Jubilant Foods, Laurus Labs, Tech Mahindra, Voltas, and life insurance players.  &ldquo;Nifty consensus earnings for FY24/25 have seen earnings changes of -1.1 percent/-1.0 percent during the results season. Earnings growth at 16 percent/14 percent is built in for FY24/FY25,&rdquo; Jefferies added.    Real estate companies reaped the benefits of strong pre-sales and firm demand. DLF and Macrotech Developers clocked a 25 percent on-year jump in PAT.  State-owned oil refining companies Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum had a standout quarter due to healthy marketing margins as a freeze on petrol and diesel prices despite a fall in input crude oil prices helped recover losses incurred when rates were high in 2022-23.  The great divide  A key trend that emerged from the Q3 show was the K-shaped recovery in the economy &ndash; robust demand in urban markets but continuing sluggishness in rural India.  Case in point &ndash; the contrasting fortunes of India&rsquo;s biggest car company and biggest FMCG firm.  Maruti Suzuki posted a 33 percent on-year jump in Q3 net profit to Rs 3,130 crore, blowing past estimates of about Rs 2,800 crore. Revenue increased 15 percent to Rs 33,309.7 crore amid strong sales of utility vehicles, which eclipsed entry-level cars as the biggest growth driver for domestic automakers.  &ldquo;The small car segment continued to remain muted and passenger vehicles sales volumes fell 16 percent YoY. Aided by a strong SUV lineup, the company&rsquo;s market share in the SUV segment improved to ~21 percent,&rdquo; analysts at Geojit said.  Hindustan Unilever, on the other hand, clocked standalone net profit growth of 0.55 percent y-o-y to Rs 2,519 crore, while revenue dipped 0.38 percent to Rs 14,928 crore.  Analyst call tracker: HUL, Asian Paints among struggling giants in consumption space  At its post-earnings call, the management said the Q3 demand trend was similar to that in Q2, with urban growing ahead of rural. It plans more premium product launches, which is growing 2.5x its mass portfolio.  &ldquo;Due to lower agriculture yields and uncertainty of future crop outputs, rural consumer sentiment remains subdued. Consequently, the anticipated buoyancy from the festive season did not materialise. The dualism we've seen in the recent past continues, with certain parts of the market recovering faster than the rest,&rdquo; Hindustan Unilever MD Rohit Jawa said on the earnings call.  Other consumer staples companies witnessed a similar trend. Biscuit maker Britannia Industries said the rural area remains a concern, and its strategy will be focused on driving market share gains.  &ldquo;We expect earnings growth to be lower due to moderate volume growth (low-to-mid single digits) given the prolonged delay in rural recovery and an increase in competitive intensity from regional/unorganised players,&rdquo; analysts at Nomura noted.  While the December quarter delivered margin expansion due to softer raw material prices, consumption companies&rsquo; short-term outlook is more dependent on premiumisation than rural demand recovery, analysts said.

The company launched the first phase of DLF Privana, Gurugram, which was sold out within 72 hours of launch and clocked bookings of over INR72b.

During the April-December period of the previous fiscal, the company's sales bookings stood at Rs 6,599 crore.  In the 2022-23 fiscal, DLF's sales bookings stood at a little over Rs 15,000 crore, and it is likely to clock higher numbers in the current fiscal.  On Wednesday, the company reported a more than three-time increase in its sales booking to Rs 9,047 crore in the December quarter as against Rs 2,507 crore in the year-ago period. &nbsp; This is the highest quarterly sales booking achieved by the company.  The record sales bookings in the third quarter were mainly driven by sales of 1,113 luxury apartments in Gurugram for Rs 7,200 crore within three days of the pre-launch last month.  In the third quarter of 2023-24, DLF launched three new projects --two in Gurugram and one in Panchkula--totalling over 5 million square feet.

Consolidation among larger and credible brands continues to be a key trend in the housing segment, primarily driven by rising confidence toward developers with strong execution legacy. In FY23, DLF&rsquo;s pre-sales doubled YoY to INR155b, driven by a strong response to a new luxury project launched in Gurugram. Its identified launch pipeline will help the company sustain the momentum.&nbsp; Expansion of new global captives, R&amp;amp;amp;D and the technology sector will boost demand for office space. In Retail, there has been a significant rebound with improved footfalls. This resurgence is primarily supported by a recovery in the luxury segment. DLF maintains a positive outlook on the rental business and is consequently deploying capital to grow the office portfolio (developing 5.3msf across Gurugram and Chennai). Given a recovery in the retail segment and consumption trends in the country, DLF has also initiated the development of new sets of malls across geographies, with an aim of doubling its retail presence in the next 4-5 years. DLF continue to strengthen its sales, CRM and project execution teams, and its upgraded ERP system has significantly enhanced the company&rsquo;s digital capabilities. Outlook The current valuation indicates that the company&rsquo;s 146msf land in DLF (DevCo.) and 24msf land in DCCDL (RentCo.) are valued at INR620b. This valuation incorporates a ~15 years of monetization timeline for the land bank, which we believe is fair.

For 9MFY23, pre-sales stood at INR66b, up 45% YoY and well on track to exceed FY23 guidance of INR80b. - The strong sales performance was driven by a INR16b contribution from the luxury floors project, The Grove, in DLF Phase V, which was fully sold out within two weeks of the launch in Sep&rsquo;22. DLFU also launched the second phase of the independent floors project in Panchkula and clocked bookings of INR5b.
