The stock continued to trade above all key moving averages (20, 50, 100 and 200-day EMAs) which is a positive sign.","Experts advised traders to maintain caution, especially after the formation of a bearish Shooting Star and a Double Top candlestick patterns on the daily charts in the previous session, followed by a bearish candlestick formation on February 5. Hence, further sharp uptrend is possible only after the Nifty 50 decisively surpasses its record high of 22,126, till then the consolidation may be seen with support at 21,500 mark, experts said, adding that the Bank Nifty seems to have turned cautious ahead of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on February 8.  On February 5, the Nifty 50 shed nearly 200 points from the day's to close 82 points down at 21,772, and the BSE Sensex fell 354 points to 71,731, while the broader markets had a mixed trend.  Stocks which reported strong performance in the Nifty 500 league included Cipla, Bharat Forge, and Redington India. Cipla ended at new closing high of Rs 1,434, continuing northward journey for four days in a row, and formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with above average volumes. The stock continued to trade above all key moving averages (20, 50, 100 and 200-day EMA - exponential moving averages) which is a positive sign.  Bharat Forge also traded above all key moving averages, rising 2.6 percent to Rs 1,272 and formed bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe. The stock has seen a breakout of downward sloping resistance trendline with above average volumes, which is a positive sign.  Redington India has also seen a decisive breakout of falling resistance trendline adjoining highs of December 12, 2022 and July 6, 2023, and recorded a robust bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts. It has seen a positive opening and clocked 8 percent gains to end a new closing high of Rs 204, with strong volumes for yet another session.  Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Cipla  Cipla managed to break its previous swing high, achieving record high closing. Since past 4 trading sessions, the stock has not given any closing below its prior day&rsquo;s low which keeps the tone positive.  Middle Bollinger band is acting as strong support for this stock i.e. Rs 1,340. Adding to the positive outlook, the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicator recently presented a bullish crossover, signaling bullish momentum can continue in the next few trading sessions.  In short, outlook for Cipla is bullish. Dips can be used as buying opportunity for a move to Rs 1,550 levels.    Bharat Forge  Bharat Forge broke its trading range of past 5 trading sessions i.e. Rs 1,200 &ndash; Rs 1,250 levels. Super Trend has given a positive signal on the daily chart which indicates bullish bias. MACD is about to give a bullish crossover for which follow up buying is needed. Nearest support is placed at Rs 1,220.  In short, Bharat Forge is bullish. A sustained move above Rs 1,275 can lift prices towards new record high levels of Rs 1,350 as long as Rs 1,220 holds on the downside.  Redington India  Redington has been moving higher and intact in strong uptrend. Prices have given a close above Rs 195 levels which confirms breakout of the Rounding Bottom. Price bounced back on the upside by taking support of the Ichimoku cloud.  In short, trend for this stock is positive. Use dips towards Rs 198 as a buying opportunity for a move towards Rs 222-225 levels as long as Rs 190 holds on the downside.

The company approved the appointment of Balram Bhargava as an additional and independent director for&nbsp;five years until March 31, 2029.  Bhargava is a prominent figure in global public health leadership and has actively championed the south-south cooperation, advocated for equitable healthcare access, supported the democratisation of scientific research, and fostered public-private collaboration to introduce new technologies and cost-effective innovative products into healthcare systems. He also brings more than 35 years of experience to the table.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  At 9.20am, the shares of Cipla were trading at Rs 1,326 on the NSE.

On that account, brokerage firm Nomura has downgraded the stock to a 'neutral' rating, with a price target of Rs 1,427 as it sees limited upside in the counter given its recent run-up and a lack of new near-term catalysts.

The bottomline growth was also aided by a 14.2 percent on-year increase in revenue to Rs&nbsp;6,544 crore in the October-December period.

The India business grew nearly 12 percent to Rs&nbsp;2,859&nbsp; crore, whereas sales from the South Africa recorded&nbsp;a near 10 percent rise to Rs 603 crore.  Growth in the India business was driven by a strong performance across branded prescription, trade generics and consumer health, while that in&nbsp;North America was supported by continuing momentum in key assets and robust demand in base business along with some year-end buying.  The South Africa business also benefitted from the increase in revenue in local currency terms.

The company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Cipla USA Inc, is voluntarily recalling the six batches of Albuterol Sulfate inhalation Aerosol 90 mcg, manufactured in November 2021, to the consumer level, Cipla Ltd said in a regulatory filing.  &amp;quot;The company is initiating a recall in the US due to a market complaint for one single inhaler (batch number - IB20056), where leakage was observed through the inhaler valve,&amp;quot; it said.  Out of an abundance of precaution, Cipla further said the specified six batches manufactured using the same lot of valves are being recalled.  On the probable associated risk, the company said, &amp;quot;There is a reasonable probability that failure to deliver the recommended dose to treat the respiratory symptoms of an acute asthma exacerbations such as wheezing coughing, shortness of breath and bronchospasms, due to device defect, may be life-threatening.&amp;quot; However, there were no adverse events reported for Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol 90 mcg related to this recall, it added.

India segment revenue continue to grow at a tepid pace due to high base effect associated with COVID 19 sales. R&amp;amp;amp;D spend is expected to continue to rise due to a likely increase in spend on differentiated portfolio of products and biosimilars, which restricts the likelihood of EBITDA margin expansion over the short &ndash; medium term.

With this, the drugmaker's net profit for the period&nbsp;lagged&nbsp;estimate of Rs&nbsp;723.4 crore, as per a poll of brokerages conducted by Moneycontrol.  The bottomline missed estimates due to an one-time loss of Rs 182.2 crore on account of goodwill impairment for Cipla's&nbsp;Yemen operations.  Revenue also&nbsp;grew 9.1&nbsp;percent on year to Rs&nbsp;5,739.30 crore,&nbsp; from Rs 5,260.33 crore seen&nbsp;in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, Cipla said in an exchange filing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably, revenue was also largely in-line with&nbsp;the Street's&nbsp;verdict of Rs 5,744.42 crore.  Strong domestic market performance, along with the ramp-up in the sales of generic versions of Trokendi and Revlimid drugs, were the main driving forces behind the company's growth.  In addition, Cipla's operational performance also improved during the quarter as EBIDTA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation) margin expanded to 20.5 percent in the fourth quarter 14.3 percent in the corresponding period last year. The improved operating metric is primarily driven by better product mix.​  The company anticipates a 23-24 percent EBIDTA margin for the upcoming fiscal year. Additionally, the management expects to obtain classification for its Pithampur unit in Indore by later this month.  For context, the US Food and Drug Administration had issued a Form 483 with eight observations to the drugmaker's Pithampur unit during the fourth quarter. T This unit holds significance as the company plans to manufacture Advair, a key generic for the US market, at this site. Consequently, the regulatory snag will cause a delay in the drug's launch.  On that front, the management also clarified that a reinspection of the facility is likely to occur in the third quarter. If the outcome is negative, the company plans to file Advair from another foreign site, necessitating another round of inspection.  &amp;quot;Also, as an attempt to de-risk getting stuck in regulatory snags, Cipla will be filing major launches, from two different manufacturing sites,&amp;quot; the management stated in&nbsp;its&nbsp;earnings call.  For FY23, the drugmaker's revenue was up 4.5 percent year-on-year to an all-time high of Rs 22,753.12 crore, from FY22's Rs 21,763.34 crore.  Consolidated net profit for FY23 registered double-digit growth of 11.2 percent to Rs 2,801.91 crore as against Rs 2,516.75 crore in FY22.

It is also seen as the biggest beneficiary of a strong flu season in India ,"Drugmaker Cipla Ltd is expected to report a consolidated net profit of Rs&nbsp;723.4 crore in March quarter of FY23, a twofold jump from Rs&nbsp;362.07 crore in the year-ago period, when it will share its numbers on May 12.  Brokerages polled by Moneycontrol pegged the company&rsquo;s revenue at Rs&nbsp;5,744.425 crore. The topline in the corresponding quarter of the previous year was at Rs 5,260 crore.  Strong traction in the domestic market, coupled with gTrokendi/gRevlimid ramp up, would be the primary contributors to the company's growth.  According to global research and broking firm Jefferies, Cipla could also&nbsp;be the biggest&nbsp;beneficiary of a strong flu season in&nbsp;India, which may result in a 12 percent year-on-year growth, with a room for positive surprise.  Philip Capital also sees room for a positive surprise from&nbsp;Cipla,&nbsp;given the strong operating performance, low base and contribution from gRevlimid, a blood cancer drug.  The same reason was attributed by several brokerages as the key factor for the expected stellar growth in the domestic market.  The EBIDTA margin is also likely to expand&nbsp; 506 basis points on year to 19.3 percent&nbsp;for January-March, mainly driven by a better product mix. EBITDA is short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. One basis point is one-hundredth of&nbsp; a percentage point.  The Street will also be watching out for the management's commentary on the Indore facility and Advair launch.  On May 11, the stock closed 0.15 percent down at Rs 943 on the National Stock Exchange.
