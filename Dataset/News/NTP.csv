In a recent report, Jefferies said that power demand is up 8 percent in 9M FY24, and is expected to continue growing. This increase in demand has been realised over the last couple of years, aided by the government efforts towards complete electrification in both rural and urban India.  Further, the power sector has seen substantially reduced costs and losses, which has led to increased investments into the sector.  Finally, as part of the government's move towards Green Energy, a number of schemes and incentives have been announced to encourage the use of renewable energy. In the interim budget, the sector received an allocation of around Rs 30,000 crore -- 50 percent more than the previous year&rsquo;s revised estimates. This overall sentiment for the segment has been beneficial to power stocks. Some of the biggest gainers in the segment in the last one year have been NTPC (1-year return: 98 percent), JSW Energy (124 percent) and Torrent Power (128 percent). Power finance firm stocks PFC and REC have also gained nearly 3x over the last one year.  1. Full electrification boosts power demand    Full electrification of both rural and urban India has resulted in the increased availability of power to about 21-22 hours in rural areas, up from 12.5 hours in 2015. Urban areas&rsquo; power availability is at 23.8 hours. Energy demand has risen two-and-a-half times from 592 billion units (BU) in FY 2005 to 1,512 BU in FY2023. &ldquo;The momentum is continuing with 9M FY24 energy demand at 1,225 BU, a 7.6 percent YoY increase,&rdquo; JM Financial said. This has been aided by an increase in power transfer capacity, and infrastructure development such as substations and transmission lines.  2. Reduction in losses: Dues and AT&amp;amp;amp;C    The power sector has seen significant improvement in cash flows, and reduction in outstanding dues from discoms. High AT&amp;amp;amp;C (aggregate technical and commercial losses) and low billing have historically limited investments in the whole power value chain. But now this is changing. &ldquo;AT&amp;amp;amp;C losses have reduced from 25.72 percent in FY2015 to 15.40 percent in FY 2023 as a result of various initiatives like installation of smart metres, mandatory energy accounting and audit system etc,&amp;quot; the report added.  Outstanding discom dues have also been reduced with the implementation of the Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules, 2022 in June 2022. Under this, the total outstanding dues of generating companies have reduced from Rs 1,400 billion in FY2022 to around Rs 495 billion in FY2023. With increased cash flow, these companies are able to invest in increased capacity and storage facilities.  3. Increasing renewable capacity and storage    Renewable power generation capacity in India stands at 130,957 MW, with 104 GW of renewable projects under construction. The government expects a renewable capacity addition of 322GW&nbsp; by FY2032 as part of their plan to achieve 500 GW by 2030. The government has also been focussing on adding energy storage capacities, especially in the hydropower space. Currently, pumped storage projects of 4.7 GW are operational, the report adds with about 3-4 GW under construction; and 35GW under clearances.  4. Thermal power capacity expansion on the rise too    While there has been a push for renewables, in order to ensure continuous power demand, there has also been a renewed focus on investments to expand thermal capacity. Currently around 26,380 MW of thermal capacity is under construction, while another 11,960 MW has been bid out, and 19,050 MW is awaiting clearance. The government has a target to add 93,380 MW of thermal capacity by FY2032.

Market Coupling implementation  Recently CERC (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission), the power regulator, directed Grid India to develop a software within two months for the market coupling pilot for a duration of two months across all three exchanges.

In a report, the analysts have rejected positive outlook on the sector, citing concerns about near-term focus, profitability, and overlooking risks in the medium term, business models, and disruptions.  PSU stocks surged 19-443&nbsp;percent in the past year, led by capital goods, electric utilities, financials, and oil&nbsp;and gas. &amp;quot;We find certain assumptions, surrounding the medium-to-long-term growth and profitability of these sectors, to be highly optimistic. We doubt much has changed in most sectors,&amp;quot; the Kotak report said.  PSUs in capital goods experienced a notable rerating on the back of increased order flow, but Kotak has warned of underestimated risks in assuming prolonged large order inflows, especially in sectors like thermal electricity generation.&nbsp;&amp;quot;The government&rsquo;s three-in-one role of buyer, owner and policymaker&nbsp;or regulator creates uncertainty regarding the companies&rsquo; future earnings and returns,&amp;quot; it said.  In electric utilities, Kotak notes a significant rerating, highlighting NTPC's valuation concerns and the market's overestimation of growth potential for&nbsp;PowerGrid. The transition to solar electricity and competitive tariff-based bidding projects pose risks, according to the analysts.  &amp;quot; We are puzzled by the market&rsquo;s confidence,&amp;quot; Kotak wrote on the rally in&nbsp;state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs). In OMCs,&nbsp;the&nbsp;rerating was driven by high profitability assumptions, but Kotak has questioned market confidence, citing volatile marketing margins and optimistic profitability assumptions. &amp;quot;The government pricing policy uncertainty and low FCF-to-PAT ratios make P/E-based valuations irrelevant,&amp;quot; it said.  Portfolio revision  Kotak said it has added Pidilite Industries to its portfolio with a weight of 150 basis points while exiting PowerGrid Corp (190 bps). The brokerage house has redistributed the remaining 40 bps to SBI Life.  PowerGrid Corp's robust performance, with a 69&nbsp;percent return over the past year, is now trading at 2.4X FY2026 BV &mdash; a considerable premium compared to its fair multiple of around 1.5X BV. While historically viewed as a prime investment for India's electrification, current valuations seem to be reflecting the anticipated growth opportunities for the next few years, it said.  The brokerage house is reassured by Pidilite's strong earnings visibility in the thriving residential real estate up-cycle, expecting it to continue for the next few years. Pidilite's solid market position and potential weakening competition are factors contributing to this confidence. The company's profitability, despite recent price cuts and increased advertising and promotion spending, is considered comfortable.  Additionally, Pidilite's low risk of disruption sets it apart from other building materials products. Adhesives, a key product, are likely to remain B2C, unlike other building products that may transition to B2B as development trends shift towards larger projects by major developers, Kotak said.

Thus, NTPC&rsquo;s plan to add commercial thermal power capacities of ~10 GW over three years seems to be a step in the right direction. Thermal capacity additions would drive double-digit growth in the standalone regulated equity base and the same provides earnings growth/cashflow visibility over FY24-25. Moreover, NTPC&rsquo;s RE expansion plan of 20GW/60GW by FY26E/FY32E would mean meaningful EBITDA contribution from RE portfolio but NTPC&rsquo;s current market capitalisation does not fully reflect RE potential. In our view, a likely IPO for NTPC Green Energy Limited would help derive better valuation of NTPC RE business and potential value unlocking for investors. NTPC&rsquo;s focus on new areas of green hydrogen/battery storage would diversify earnings streams in medium to long term.  Outlook We maintain Buy on NTPC with an unchanged PT of Rs. 260.
