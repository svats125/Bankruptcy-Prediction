We believe recalibration measures taken to reset the cost structure by re-visiting content, technology, marketing and people spends will take some time to unfold and the competitive landscape is likely to evolve after merger of Disney-Viacom18.

At 1.23pm, the&nbsp;Zee&nbsp;shares were trading at Rs 158.75 on the NSE. Volumes in the counter were also sharply high as 6 crore shares changed hands on the exchanges, significantly more than the one-month daily traded average of 4 crore shares.

The much-awaited merger came to a nasty&nbsp;end on January 22 after Sony Pictures terminated the process that could have created a $10-billion media behemoth.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  Sony entities Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment had also terminated their merger agreement, citing unfulfilled conditions, and sought a $90-million termination fee from Zee.  The merger was seen as the bigger growth catalyst for the media company that is otherwise roiled in controversies around its corporate governance issues. However, with the merger fallout, the Street's sentiment towards Zee has taken a hit.  Analysts across the Street anticipate hard times for the media company, especially at a time when Reliance Industries' deal with Disney India is expected to increase competitive intensity within the industry.

Ad spends shifted to the Cricket World Cup, which took place&nbsp;in 2023 from October 5 to November 19. The tournament was aired on Disney Star&rsquo;s sports channels.  While there was some seasonal festive uptick in the third quarter of FY24, the overall pace of recovery in ad spends continues to be slow. Zee&nbsp;reported ad revenue&nbsp;of Rs&nbsp;1,027.4 crore, down from Rs&nbsp;1,063.4 crore a year earlier. Sequentially, ad revenue grew from Rs&nbsp;979.2 crore in Q2.  &amp;quot;We saw some gradual pickup in ad spending, led by FMCG. Our ad revenues were up 4.9 percent quarter-on-quarter. The pace of ad spend recovery is still muted and that reflects in YoY comparison. While we have seen some recovery in the last few months, many of our large FMCG brands are still circumspect on volume recovery. Hence, we will continue to be cautious in the near term on ad revenue growth,&amp;quot; said Rohit Gupta, chief financial officer &nbsp;at Zee Entertainment.  Also read:&nbsp;Zee Ent Q3 profit up 1.4x to Rs 58.5 crore, revenue increases 14.8%  The sentiment on ad spend was similar in the previous quarter when the company said the drop in ad expenditure by edtech, fintech, foodtech, and e-commerce companies posed a challenge for broadcasters.  Gradual recovery  Analysts note that while the gradual recovery in ad revenue with improving spends from the FMCG segment appears to be a silver lining, the recovery will remain gradual as certain brands continue to see slower growth due to the rural slowdown.  Brokerage firm&nbsp;Motilal Oswal has&nbsp;revised down its operating profit and profit after tax estimates for Zee in FY25 by 8&nbsp;percent and 11 percent, respectively, on the back of the laggard recovery in ad revenue.  &amp;quot;While our recent performance has been subdued, and a large part of this has been due to temporary and transitory factors, the structure strength and attractiveness of our business is still very strong, giving us confidence on our recovery path,&amp;quot; Gupta said.

Streaming platform Zee5's revenue in Q3 rose 14.9 percent YoY to Rs 223.2 crore, driven by improved subscription. Its operating loss narrowed to Rs&nbsp;244 crore from Rs&nbsp;282 crore a year earlier and&nbsp;Rs 253.9 crore in Q2.  During Q3, the over the top (OTT) platform launched 19 shows and movies including&nbsp;five originals. The broadcaster will&nbsp;revise its OTT cost structure in Zee5, which is already at its peak.  Zee will also revisit the overall cost structure across tech, content, marketing, and people with a view to reset to a lower cost baseline as it enters&nbsp;FY25.  The company said that it has identified several cost levers but there will be a one-time cost.  &amp;quot;For the next three to six months, we will likely have some pressure on margins due to increased one-time high costs towards implementing these interventions,&amp;quot; Gupta said.  There may be some layoffs in Zee Entertainment as the company rationalises employee costs to improve profitability, CEO Punit Goenka said during the Q3 earnings call.  Sony terminated a merger plan with Zee last month, a deal that was signed over two years ago and was set to build a $10 billion combined entity. Sony said Zee did not satisfy the merger conditions and initiated arbitration proceedings claiming $90 million (Rs 748.5 crore) as a termination fee.

Claims made by Sony, including demand of $90-mn termination fee, not tenable: Zee Entertainment  &amp;quot;The company's proposed merger was terminated by Sony through a communication received on January 22, 2024. The same was reviewed by our Board and appropriate steps have been taken into consideration with the legal experts that are in the best interest of our shareholders and stakeholders. We have even approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to seek&nbsp;direction on the implementation of the scheme,&amp;quot; the CEO said.  Zee&nbsp;is now revisiting plans as a standalone company and is focusing on enhancing its performance in the coming quarters. The company reported a 140 percent increase in profit at Rs 58.5 crore in the December quarter of FY24 up from Rs 24.32 crore during the same period a year ago.  &amp;quot;In Q3FY24, overall operating costs declined by 12.8&nbsp;percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) due to lower content costs, fewer movie releases and continuous cost optimization in Zee5. Given our business has high operating leverage, despite effective cost management, EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) margins has declined to 10.2&nbsp;percent. Net profit for the quarter and year was impacted by merger expenses related exceptional items which came to about Rs 60.3 crore during the quarter,&amp;quot; said&nbsp;Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Rohit Gupta.

While we will somewhat depend on macro recovery for overall revenue growth, to have a better degree of control on our cost structure we are revisiting with frugality and a fiscal prudence mindset,&amp;quot; the CFO said.

Star India had sent letters to Zee alleging a breach&nbsp;of the agreement during the December quarter of FY24 on account of non-payment of dues for the rights concerning the first instalment of the rights fee aggregating to $203.56 million or&nbsp;Rs 1,693.42 crore. This was along with the payment for bank guarantee commission and deposit interest aggregating Rs 17&nbsp;crore&nbsp;and financial commitments including furnishing of corporate guarantee confirmation as stated in the alliance agreement, Zee said in a document released along with its Q3FY24 results on February 13.  On the other hand, Zee said that Star has&nbsp;not acted as per the agreement and has failed to obtain necessary approvals, and execution of necessary documentation and agreements.&nbsp;The company's management believes that Star by its conduct has breached the Alliance Agreement and is in default of the terms thereof and consequently, the contract stands repudiated.  For the agreement regarding the ICC sports rights, Zee said it has accrued Rs 72.14 crore for bank guarantee commission and interest expenses as per the Alliance Agreement.  Zee said that it has communicated to Star that the alliance agreement cannot be preceded and has sought a refund of Rs&nbsp;68.54 crore paid to Star.  Claims made by Sony, including demand of $90-mn termination fee, not tenable: Zee Entertainment  Case history  On August 26, 2022, Zee entered into an Alliance Agreement with Star India&nbsp;Private Limited in which Star would grant sub-licensing rights concerning television broadcasting rights of the International&nbsp;Cricket Council's, (ICC) Men's and Under 19 (U-19) global events&nbsp;for a period of&nbsp;four years (ICC 2024-2027) on an exclusive basis.  Disney Star acquired the ICC TV and digital rights for India from 2024 to 2027 for $3 billion. It retained the digital rights and sub-licensed the TV rights for the men's and Under-19 global events to Zee. The ICC Under-19 Men's Cricket World Cup 2024, held from January 19 to February 11, was the first tournament under the new media rights cycle.  While Zee said that it had identified this acquisition of strategic importance, analysts have pointed out that the deal would result in annual losses of&nbsp;Rs 1,520&nbsp;crore in FY25 and beyond&nbsp;due to high&nbsp;content cost, lower sports ad revenue and cricket content are available for free on streaming platform.  In addition, after Sony terminated the merger, experts had said that Zee may&nbsp;not be able to fulfil this commitment of the ICC sports rights deal with a cash balance of Rs 600&nbsp;crore.  While some legal experts have said that Disney Star may not hesitate to take Zee to court if it fails to honour the agreement, Zee has said that it has strong and valid grounds to defend any claims.","Companies, Entertainment, Technology",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/technology/star-alleges-non-paymentinstalment-for-icc-sports-rights-deal-zee-claims-breachagreement_17449191.html

The closing above its previous high and record high closing indicate strength in the stock.","&amp;quot;The Nifty IT index has been forming higher highs and higher lows, keeping the overall tone positive. Crucial level to observe is 37,000. A breakthrough above this level can take prices higher towards the 39,000 levels,&amp;quot; Ashish Kyal, CMT, founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors, says in an interview to Moneycontrol.  Overall tone for IT will remain bullish for months, he believes. And one can use dips to buy stocks from this sector, he advised.  Kyal, with more than two decades of experience in capital markets, suggested five budget picks, including AIA Engineering, Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT), and Strides Pharma. Excerpts from an interview with Moneycontrol:  Do you think the rally is done in IRFC and Rail Vikas Nigam which were the top gainers in the current month?  Both IRFC and RVNL has shown near-vertical rise but reversed sharply on January 23. These stocks are still overbought and further profit-booking is possible in these stocks after the Union Budget.  Prices are already discounting positive outcome from the Budget session and can show dramatic reversals. So, one should now be cautious on these stocks as long as lifetime high levels remain protected.  Also read:&nbsp;Stockology: Watch for divergence indicators in a volatile trading week  Are the charts telling you that the selling pressure is done in Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Polycab India?  For ZEEL, after recent decision to call off the planned merger with Sony, Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) experienced selling pressure and closed the last week with loss of 29.47 percent. The downtrend is evident on weekly chart. The formation of strong bearish candle and closing below its previous crucial support level of 175 is confirming the bearish bias.  On the daily chart, after significant sell-off on Tuesday price is trading within the range since past two trading sessions which is Rs 171&ndash;157 levels. RSI (relative strength index) is trading near the 23 level, which is indicating that prices are in the oversold area, so a short-term pullback is possible but use that as an opportunity to sell.  Also read:&nbsp;Market Action: Six IPOs to hit Dalal Street, 10 listings lined up  In short, ZEEL is bearish. A breach below Rs 157 can drag the prices lower towards the Rs 150 level with hurdles near Rs 185 on the upside.  For Polycab India, after news of the Income Tax (I-T) department detected &amp;quot;unaccounted cash sales&amp;quot; of about Rs 1,000 crore, the stock tanked 23 percent on January 11 which has changed the overall structure to negative. Formation of a bearish candle suggests that the short-term bias is bearish.  After strong selling pressure price is consolidating in range of Rs 4,550 &ndash; 3,800 since the past two weeks. The price broke its previous support of Rs 4,800 which is also confirming the bearish bias. Ichimoku cloud is indicating weakness in price cloud has formed near Rs 4,750 which can act as a potential resistance.  In short, Polycab is sideways to bearish. A breach below Rs 4,050 can drag the prices lower at the Rs 3,650 level, whereas a break above Rs 4,550 can result into a deeper pullback towards Rs 4,700.  Do you expect the Nifty 50 to consolidate with support at the 21,000 mark in the coming weeks? What are the chances of the index hitting 20,500 -20,000 levels?  The Nifty has been forming lower highs and lower lows after touching a lifetime high levels near 22,124 on the upside. This was also near the target we have mentioned in earlier interviews. After forming the high, there was a sharp reversal on the downside.  Over the past few days, we can see rangebound movement. On the downside, a breach below 21,210 might open the downside possibilities to 20,800, followed by 20,500 levels. However, on the upside, the major hurdle is near 21,720 followed by 21,840 levels. A move above this will suggest upside reversal.  For now, the index is trading at crucial juncture before the Budget. Prices are failing to show momentum on either side. After a strong run-up until January 15, short-term correction is a healthy sign for the overall long-term positive market trend. In a nutshell, the 21,210 support will be a crucial level to be watched over the short term.  Do you think the 44,000 is expected to be crucial support for the Bank Nifty for coming weeks?  Bank Nifty has been major contributor to the downside. It has been leading the fall and the Bank Nifty showed one of the steepest declines from January 16, 2024. Over the near term, 44,300 remains an important support for this index and if this is breached, we can expect the downside momentum to increase for a move to the 43,600 levels.  On the upside, 46,200 is going to be a short-term resistance. A move above this is must for meaningful pullbacks. As long as the same is intact, the banking index can remain under pressure.  Is the Nifty IT creating rounding bottom pattern on the weekly and monthly charts? Does it mean that completion and breakout of the same pattern in coming weeks or months can generate robust returns in following weeks or months?  In December 2023, Nifty IT has shown strong breakout of consolidation pattern. In our past interviews we have mentioned bullish stand when the index was near 32,000 levels and since then prices have rallied by nearly 15 percent to close last week at 36,500 levels.  The IT index has been forming higher highs and higher lows keeping the overall tone positive.  Crucial level to observe is 37,000. A breakthrough above this level can take prices higher towards the 39,000 levels. Overall tone for IT will remain bullish for months ahead and one can use dips to buy stocks from this sector.  Which are you top 5 budget picks and why?  AIA Engineering  AIA Engineering has recently witnessed a breakout from the range Rs 3,300 &ndash; 3,800 levels, with the price managing to close above the range. The stock has broken out from an attractive technical pattern which is ascending triangle pattern. A follow-up action beyond Rs 3,910 level, price can reach towards uncharted territory setting new record highs for target of Rs 4,200.  Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT)  After a long consolidation phase, FACT broke the range in previous trading session. The price is trading above the breakout from ascending triangle pattern, signalling a bullish bias. The closing above its previous high and record high closing indicate strength in the stock.  The technical indicator MACD aligns with the breakout, which is confirming the positive outlook. The increasing volume also suggest bullish momentum likely to continue in next few trading session. In short, FACT is bullish for move to Rs 960 as long as Rs 780 remains intact on downside.  Strides Pharma  Since December lows, there has been an impressive 44 percent rally in Strides Pharma, followed by a 16-day consolidation period. Flag and Pole pattern is indicating a potential continuation of the upward trend. A break above Rs 695 can further lift prices towards Rs 760 levels, as long as price holds Rs 640 on the downside.  Gujarat Pipavav Port  Gujarat Pipavav Port is showing good consolidation after a strong run up and can again resume the positive trend. On previous day, the stock showed strong volumes and managed to close above prior high. In this week, we expect a move to Rs 176 levels as long as Rs 154 remains protected on downside.  Indian Bank  The stock has been consolidating since many weeks. The stock is now trading near upper end of the range. Break above Rs 470 will result into strong positive breakout in this stock for a move to Rs 500 level as long as Rs 440 is intact on downside.

Sony is likely to issue a termination notice by 20-Jan-24; now, the decision on who would be at the helm of the merged company is the contentious issue, according to these reports. After receiving all necessary regulatory approvals, this breakdown can be a setback to both Sony and Zee, having both reported subpar growth over the last year. We believe the merger not going through will be a lose-lose for both parties, particularly in the face of competition with a much larger entity of Reliance-Disney (if the merger goes through). Both parties will potentially have to recalibrate their strategies from ground zero, which would be a tall order.  Outlook We believe clarity should emerge in the next couple of weeks regarding a final decision concerning the merger, and if it does not go through, we see significant downside from current levels.

Considering the trend and the kind of resilience shown by these stocks, he believes that both GSFC and MOIL would generate healthy alpha from here for positional traders before and after the budget.  On the Bank Nifty, which corrected for a fourth consecutive week, the financial market expert with more than 16 years of experience feels that the fall in Bank Nifty from here would be limited as most of the negatives have been discounted in the price recently.  Considering the consolidation around 200-day EMA, do you think the Bank Nifty is over with the correction? Or do you see the index breaking October lows in the coming days?  For the last two trading sessions, Bank Nifty has been finding support on its 200 DEMA (day exponential moving average), which is currently placed at 44,568. Bank Nifty has already witnessed a healthy correction of more than 4,200 points from the all-time high of 48,636 registered in December 2023. 200 DEMA always has high significance as support when benchmark indices reach near it after a healthy correction.  Below 200 DEMA, we see strong support coming in the range of 43,800-44,000, derived from the upward sloping trend line, which adjoins the weekly low of March 17, 2023 and October 27, 2023. The recent fall in Bank Nifty is more sector-specific and there is no across-the-board weakness in other sectors.  Also read:&nbsp;Momentum mania: 12 new midcap stocks entered the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index  The breadth of the market is very strong and that&rsquo;s why we feel that the fall in Bank Nifty from here would be limited as most of the negatives have been discounted in the price recently. The maximum downside could be up to 43,800 odd levels in case the index breaks 200 DEMA support.  October 2023 bottom is placed at 42,105 and we see less probability of that happening in the coming days.  Are the charts telling you that the Nifty 50 will break the 20,500 mark in the coming weeks, before resuming another leg of up move?  No. If correction were to continue, we see Nifty finding support in the zone of 20,800-20,900, derived from upward sloping trendline adjoining the weekly highs of July 21, 2023 and September 15, 2023. There is a huge unfilled gap in the range of 20,507-20,291.  In the bear case scenario, Nifty is expected to find support in this gap zone. Any level above 21,600 would negate the recent downtrend. The best part of in Indian market is the strong breadth, which gives us the confidence that the downside would be limited in benchmark indices from the current levels.  Also read:&nbsp;Budget and Markets: Will the PSU rally continue post-budget?  Has the Zee Entertainment Enterprises bottomed out after severe correction?  No. Zee Entertainment has nosedived more than 40 percent month to date. The stock has breached the previous swing low of Rs 170 on the long-term charts. It has also confirmed the bearish Head and Shoulder pattern on the monthly chart. So positionally stock looks weak.  However, we can not rule out the possibility of a pullback rally after such a steep fall in a short period. We see strong resistance between Rs 175 and Rs 180 in the stock.  Which are your top two budget picks, and why?  GSFC (Gujarat State Fertilizers &amp;amp;amp; Chemicals) and MOIL  Fertiliser, mining and PSU sectors have been outperforming and the same is expected to continue from here. Both stocks have bullish setups on the short to medium-term charts. Considering the trend and the kind of resilience shown by these stocks, we believe that both GSFC and MOIL would generate healthy alpha from here for positional traders before and after the budget.  RITES was the biggest gainer in the Nifty 500 index. Do you see the stock extending its upward move in the coming weeks too?  In technical analysis, we say the trend is your friend. If a stock is resilient and is into bullish momentum, traders should always be with it. No matter what the reason is, railway stocks have been showing a great amount of strength on the charts.  The stock can remain overbought for a longer period unless the price breaks the support. At present stock is at its all-time high and the trend is expected to remain bullish in the coming days. The pattern target for the stock comes in at Rs 730 odd levels, where traders can think of booking profits or raising stop-loss.  KPIT Technologies seems to have decisively broken the consolidation on the downside. Do you see the stock falling towards 200-day EMA once?  The stock has broken down below the last 10 week&rsquo;s price consolidation with a jump in volumes. In history, we saw this stock finding support near its 100 DEMA multiple times, which is currently placed at Rs 1,350 odd levels. The sustainable level below Rs 1,350 could drag the stock towards its 200 DEMA, placed at Rs 1,212 odd levels.  Do you think Nifty IT will consolidate in the coming weeks by taking support at around 35,500-36,000 area?  IT Index is all set to register a new all-time high above 39,447. At present, the Nifty IT index is down 7.5 percent from its all-time high. This is the only recognized sectoral Index which has failed to register a new all-time high in the bullish rally that started in April 2023.  Recently we observed bullish momentum coming back to the IT index. So yes, there is good support in the zone of 35,500-36,000 in the Nifty IT index and the same should be utilized to create fresh long positions in IT stocks.

After two years of twists and turns in&nbsp;the merger pact that was signed in 2021, Japan's Sony Group snapped the negotiations. The bone of contention was the merged entity's leadership as Sony was against Zee CEO Punit Goenka taking the charge&nbsp;due to a regulatory probe against him.  &amp;quot;Sony has already made it clear to initiate a legal battle by claiming $90 million fees as per the Agreement and so has Zee wherein they would be claiming for damages,&amp;quot; said&nbsp;Alay Razvi, Partner, Accord Juris LLP, Hyderabad.  Zee in a statement noted that Goenka had agreed to step down in the interest of the merger and proposals in this regard were discussed, including for appointment of a director on the Board of the merged company, in the best interest of Zee&rsquo;s directors and shareholders.  &amp;quot;The actual reason for Sony terminating the merger remains unknown,&amp;quot; pointed out Karan Taurani, senior vice-president of Elara Capital.  The $90-million question  Now, the question is whether Zee will be liable to pay the termination fees which will be an additional burden to the company which is already dealing with low cash balance.  &amp;quot;Both parties will undergo an arbitration process for resolution of their disputes under the merger, said Dhiraj Mhetre, partner&nbsp;at Khaitan Legal Associates.  The determination of Zee's liability for paying termination fees to Sony is expected to be resolved through a competent legal forum, following the dispute resolution mechanism outlined in the contract, said Pratyush Miglani, managing partner&nbsp;at MVAC Advocates &amp;amp;amp; Consultants. &amp;quot;This suggests that a prolonged legal battle is on the horizon.&amp;quot;  Unless the parties are willing to walk away from this deal amicably, and without seeking costs from each other; we may be looking at a long legal battle arising from the fallout of this merger deal, said Abhilash Agrawal, counsel (corporate)&nbsp;at Law SB.  Also read:&nbsp;Sony calls off $10-billion merger deal, Zee denies allegations  He said that courts have&nbsp;routinely dismissed claims for the exact amounts of penalty imposed by one party on another. In case of Zee instituting a legal remedy then&nbsp;Sony will have to justify the quantum of termination fee being sought.  &amp;quot;If Zee refuses to pay the 'termination fee', Sony will have a right to approach the arbitral tribunal/courts claiming the same. Zee can claim bad faith on part of Sony in terminating the agreement, stating the real reason for the termination is that Sony wanted to renege on the terms of their Agreement, which provided for, inter alia, Punit Goenka being appointed as the managing director of the proposed merged entity, which Sony didn&rsquo;t want,&amp;quot; he added.  Also read:&nbsp;Zee refutes all claims by Sony, says evaluating options  Both&nbsp;sides hit&nbsp;hard  With TV facing competition from the digital media, Zee and Sony have been under pressure. Due to a weak advertising environment,&nbsp;Sony India&rsquo;s ad revenue declined 4 percent year-on-year (YoY) in FY23 to Rs 3,300 crore, while Zee&rsquo;s ad revenue fell 8 percent YoY to Rs 4,100 crore.&nbsp;Subscription revenue also remained under pressure in the last financial year because of a prolonged delay in the implementation of New Tariff Order 3.0 (NTO).  There has been significant erosion of the competitive position of Zee along with its financials, said&nbsp;Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD of InGovern Research Services, a proxy advisory firm. &amp;quot;Zee has less than Rs 500 crore cash equivalents to fund its growth and ward off the competitive pressures. Sony will have to chart its own growth path,&amp;quot; he said.  Mhetre said that the termination of the merger will significantly impact Sony's efforts to expand its market share in the growing Indian market.  Zee could also be hit from related penalty or legal proceedings due to the battle with Sony over the non-compete fee, the ongoing legal proceedings by various creditors of the Essel group including Axis Finance, IDBI Bank and because of the likelihood of not fulfilling the contract with Disney, said Taurani.  Also read:&nbsp;Zee-Sony merger called off: A timeline of how the $10 billion deal took off and derailed  &amp;quot;Zee had signed a contract with Disney for sub-franchise of sports rights (ICC tournaments) on TV from 2024 to 2027. Zee may now not fulfil this commitment as it has a cash balance of mere Rs 600 crore, versus potential contractual obligation of Rs 4,000 crore per year,&amp;quot; he added.  Before the termination of the merger with Sony, Zee could have cited the monetary infusion of $1.5 billion the combined entity would have received from Sony, said Agrawal. &amp;quot;Now, Zee will have a tough time servicing its dues to Disney, and may be looking at a legal action from Disney for breach of their agreement. This goes into the realm of legality of penalty clauses in India, which is governed by the provisions of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.&amp;quot;  Also read:&nbsp;ZEE spent Rs 366.6 crore on compliances for its merger with Sony  Also, the&nbsp;additional capital by Sony would have been beneficial to fund new content. In FY23,&nbsp;Zee&rsquo;s profit after tax (PAT) stood at Rs 251.4 crore, down 76 percent YoY, facing pressure mainly due to the content cost and its investments in digital. On the other hand,&nbsp;Sony recorded a PAT of Rs 1,042 crore in FY23, up 6 percent YoY.  The aftermath of the merger fallout is likely to pose more problems for Zee than Sony as Zee may have to face a claim from Sony for the termination fee along with other financial commitments, said Agrawal.  Why the merger was key  The&nbsp;merger would have created the largest entertainment network in India with a 26 percent share of the viewership pie with&nbsp;better growth in advertising revenue than the industry average, analysts had said. While Zee would have benefited from Sony's strength in&nbsp;general entertainment (GEC) and sports, Sony had the advantage of Zee having an edge in regional content. The merger would also have helped the streaming platforms ZEE5 and SonyLIV&nbsp;with a scope to increase subscription video on-demand (SVOD) base&nbsp;and improvement in average revenue per user (ARPU).  While it is to be seen what will be Zee's next steps,&nbsp;there is a likelihood of the top five shareholders owning 30 percent of Zee, to work out a deal with Sony and without Zee CEO Punit Goenka.  &amp;quot;The legal impact of this merger termination may involve legal proceedings that could influence the reputation and future business endeavours of the parties involved,&amp;quot; said Rajesh Sivaswamy, senior partner&nbsp;at King Stubb &amp;amp;amp; Kasiva, Advocates and Attorneys.","Companies, Technology, Zee Enteratinment, Zee-Sony merger",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/technology/zee-sony-legal-war-over-failed-deal-hinges3690-mn-termination-fees_17410291.html

In an exchange filing, the media company further said that&nbsp;it&nbsp;is committed to the merger with Sony and is continuing to work towards a successful closure of the proposed merger and is engaging in good faith negotiations with Sony with a view to discuss the extension of the date required to make the (merger) scheme effective, by a reasonable period of time.  While the expected completion of the deal was December 21, 2023, Zee had sought deadline extension and Sony had agreed to it.&nbsp;According to reports, a&nbsp;30-day period after the December 21 deadline was included in the merger pact signed in 2021 if either party sought more time.  More time was sought by Zee to address the crucial issue of whether&nbsp;Punit Goenka, Zee's chief executive officer, will helm the combined entity, a&nbsp;clause which is part of the deal.&nbsp;While Sony was on board for Goenka's leadership when the merger was announced, the change of heart happened&nbsp;due a regulatory probe against Goenka.  In June last year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) alleged that Zee engaged in deceptive practices by falsely claiming the recovery of loans to hide private financing deals linked to Zee Chairman Subhash Chandra. The market regulator, in an interim order, stated that Chandra and his son Goenka misused their positions and diverted funds. As a result, Goenka was prohibited from holding executive or director positions in listed companies.  While Goenka got a reprieve from an appellate authority against the Sebi order, reports noted that Sony viewed the ongoing probe as a corporate governance issue.

A war chest of USD1.6b (capital infusion) and steady annual EBITDA generation capability of ~INR40-50b from the linear business should enable the company to compete within the high-growth digital segment and to fund its recent foray into the sports segment. Further, the company&rsquo;s deep understanding of the Indian entertainment market, better bargaining power, and ability to produce a strong line-up of content should allow it to have a strong play within the OTT space. We believe the current valuations do not fully capture the combined entity&rsquo;s potential growth catalysts. While there has been some stability in subscription revenue with the implementation of NTO 3.0, the persistent softness in the ad market and the company&rsquo;s decisions on content investment would be the key factors to watch out for.  Outlook We retain BUY on the stock with a TP of INR320, valuing the company at 7x EV/EBITDA for the linear business and 1x EV/sales for the OTT segment on FY25 estimates.

Reiterate BUY with a TP of INR280, based on 26x FY25E EPS. Outlook Valuing the stock at 26x FY25E EPS, we arrive at a TP of INR280. We maintain our BUY rating.

Zee Entertainment Enterprise&rsquo;s (Z IN) operational performance was marginally better than our expectation with EBITDA margin of 7.8% (PLe of 6.3%) but PAT was derailed by an exceptional charge of Rs706mn.  Outlook We expect sales CAGR of 8% over next 2 years with EBITDA margin of 12.4%/18.1% in FY24E/FY25E and retain BUY with a revised TP of Rs 276 as we increase our target multiple to 22x (earlier 19x). Unfavorable NCLT verdict (Z IN has right to appeal in NCLAT in that case) and slower recovery in ad-environment can act as a key overhang in near term.
