(DMart) owns &amp;amp;amp; operates India&rsquo;s most profitable supermarket chain, DMart. It provides products like food, non-food (FMCG), general merchandise &amp;amp;amp; apparel through 341 stores (total 14.2mn sq. ft). We maintain our BUY rating with a revised target price of Rs. 4,300 owing to healthy revenue growth and store additions. Revenue grew by 17%YoY, aided by store additions, however, profitability was lower (gross margin declined by 10bpsYoY to 14.2%) due to inflationary stress on discretionary product demand. Operating profit grew by 15%YoY as EBITDA margin declined by 10bps YoY to 8.5% (8.1% QoQ). As per management, contribution from high margin segments has stabilized and the trend is encouraging. This along with moderating inflation and healthy store additions will improve earnings growth. We reduce our margin assumptions and expect Revenue/PAT to grow at a 22%/20% CAGR over FY23-25E. DMart currently trades at 75x 1Yr Fwd PE. We value DMart on a DCF basis, which implies 63x on FY26 EPS.  Outlook DMart has strong growth potential given its healthy balance sheet with no debt and strong operational efficiency. Healthy store additions will aid future revenue growth, while moderating inflation will improve discretionary demand and margins. DMart is currently trading at 75x 1Yr Fwd PE. We arrive at a target price of Rs.4,300 by valuing on a DCF basis, which implies 63x on FY26 EPS, maintaining our BUY rating.

Cost of retail inched up by 7/13bps in standalone and Consol numbers. Although General merchandise and apparel have stabilized in Q3, but loss of sales in Apparel is structural and value formats like Zudio and Reliance Trends have reduced the consumer appeal of Hypermarts. We note that store openings have been tepid in Q3 and had cut store openings to 40/45 for FY24/25. We believe the drag in the performance of Non-FMCG product is temporary and should bounce back with easing inflation over next 1-2 quarters.

Follow our market blog for live updates  On January 2, Avenue Supermarts said in a regulatory filing that standalone revenue from operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 surged 17.19 percent to Rs 13,247.33 crore. As of December, the company had a total of 341 stores.  HSBC has a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; call on the DMart stock with a target price of Rs 4,600, implying an upside of 12 percent. While the Avenue Supermarts business model is formidable, the firm needs assortment overhaul and network strategy reset, said the brokerage.  Morgan Stanley, which has an &lsquo;overweight&rsquo; call on the stock&nbsp;with a target price of Rs 4,471, also lauded operational metrics, highlighting further improvement. However, the brokerage expressed the need for an accelerated pace of store additions to bolster growth.  In the third quarter, Avenue Supermarts expanded its footprint by opening five outlets. HSBC said that this pace of store additions is relatively &amp;quot;pedestrian&amp;quot;.  HSBC analysts also highlighted that the Q3FY24 sales growth remained below the pre-Covid Levels. On the other hand, despite a sequential decline in Q3FY24 sales growth to 17&nbsp;percent on-year, the HSBC report noted an improvement in throughput.

Following are the key highlights of the event: The company targets to add 40 stores in FY24. The timing is a challenge due to longer cycles of turnaround and issues like the availability of larger stores and inflation-led high property prices. In the general merchandise and apparels category (GM&amp;amp;amp;A), general merchandise is mainly impacted by macro factors, but the apparels category is facing both macro factors and increased competitiveness. However, we believe new categories (like Pharma, etc.) should offset the impact. The management is optimistic about the e-commerce business and has expressed reasonable clarity that it may not report significant losses. It will focus on the existing 22 cities and big-basket buying through both store pick-up and home delivery channels. The gross margin impact from GM&amp;amp;amp;A is cushioned by the strategy of direct procurement from grocery brands. Usually 30-35k sqft stores mature in about three years, while larger stores (~45k sqft) mature in four to five years, giving the company potential to grow more. We factor in revenue/PAT CAGRs of 26%/27% over FY23-25E on the back of 16%/9% area/revenue productivity. Maintain BUY.

D&rsquo;Mart believes that decline in share of General Merchandise and Apparel (GMA - 21.4% of sales in 2H23) should normalize as GM (bigger part) is recovering now while Apparel needs significant restructuring. D&rsquo;Mart Ready is on fine footing with highly competitive consumer offering, improving efficiencies and strong salience in bigger cities like Hyderabad, Pune and Bengaluru, in addition to Mumbai. We factor in 13% growth in Bills cuts and 6% decline in average bill value (6% higher than 2H24) in FY24. We are building in 30/40bps decline in GM/EBIDTA margin in FY24 and 20bps expansion in FY25.

Revenue growth of 18% YoY (vs 12% retail area expansion) is un-exciting. Under recovery in general merchandise and apparel (still below pre-pandemic levels) continues to be a drag on gross margins (decline of 125 bps YoY). The stress in Apparel segment (~12% overall revenue share &ndash; per our estimate) is not a surprise for us (see report link 1, 2). Interestingly, the retail area of the newly added stores (3 stores added) has been conservatively reduced by ~19% of system average to 33,000 sq. ft. We believe, this is prudent given lower than expected business economics of the large size stores that were added over last 4-5 years. Now ~60% of DMART&rsquo;s total retail area represent large size stores (45-50k sqft stores vs 30- 35k sq. ft. pre-COVID). Also to re-highlight the point on DMART turning conservative in the offline business: during FY23 it has added ~58% stores only in the top-3 states (vs 42% during FY18-22). That said, we reckon DMart is a platform business and the downside of this underperformance (in apparels) is limited while all other strengths of the company remain intact. HOLD.

After growing the topline at this scorching pace and achieving a turnover of INR 430b, it has just about scratched the surface in our view. We believe it has a long runway for growth as the modern retail space is still in its infancy in India. Weak SSSG has weighed on DMART&rsquo;s stock price performance in the recent past.

Outlook We value DMART at 40x FY25E EV/EBITDA and an implied P/E of 64x on Jun&rsquo;25 to arrive at a TP of INR 4,200.

This was due to a.) weak demand in the margin accretive discretionary category, resulting in a 100bp drop in GM. Additionally, store productivity remained flat with no increase in revenue/sqft, likely due to larger store sizes. Over the last three years, Dmart has been adding larger stores to their retail chain. With these larger stores, the company expects to see an increase in store productivity. The previously smaller stores are expected to experience a growth plateau after ~ 3 years. This, along with gradual recovery in discretionary demand, general inflation cool off, softening RM pricing and healthy cost efficiency may see improvement in earnings growth. While the robust store adds, coupled with strong cost efficiencies, could play a key role in growth, the near-term challenges within the discretionary segment and rich valuations could be the key monitorables for the company. We have factored revenue/PAT CAGR of 26%/29% over FY23-25E, (realigning PAT downwards by 12%/3% for FY24/25E).
