Additionally, Jaguar Land Rover division of Tata Motors sold 1.01 lakh wholesale units in the third quarter which is a 27 percent YoY increase. It is also the highest wholesale figure in the last 11 quarters.  Brokerages like Morgan Stanley and Motilal Oswal had given positive ratings to the stock citing the strong sales mix with Range Rover, Ranger Rover Sport and Defender accounting for 62 percent of the wholesale.

The stock gained 2.5 percent after JLR, the company&rsquo;s luxury car division, sold 27 percent more vehicles in the December quarter of FY24 from the year-ago period.  &ldquo;JLR could be the next big re-rating driver for Tata Motors if performance is steady,&rdquo; analysts at Morgan Stanley said.  They shared an &ldquo;overweight&rdquo; rating on the counter, with a target price of Rs 890 a share, implying an upside of 10 percent from the current level.  In the past month, the stock has surged over 12 percent against a 4 percent rise in the Nifty auto index.  JLR posted wholesale volumes of 1.01 lakh units, up 27 percent YoY, which was broadly in-line with estimates, Morgan Stanley analysts said.  The Q3 mix remained strong with Range Rover, Ranger Rover Sport and Defender accounting for 62 percent of the wholesale. The company did not comment on free cash flow (FCF) but believes that JLR's FCF momentum will continue, the brokerage said.

The order book continues to&nbsp;reflect strong demand for JLR products, with 1.48 lakh client orders at the end of the third quarter.  Retail volumes were higher in all regions year-on-year. The UK was up 55&nbsp;percent, overseas 49 percent, China 28 percent, Europe 27&nbsp;percent and North America was up 6 percent.  Analysts at Motilal Oswal shared a &ldquo;buy&rdquo; rating on the counter with a target price of Rs 900 a share.  &amp;quot;The growth in JLR is likely to be supported by gradual recovery in global PV demand, a strong order book, and a favourable product mix,&rdquo; they said.  While&nbsp;JLR will continue to see a healthy recovery, growth will moderate in&nbsp;Tata Motors' passenger and commercial vehicle businesses in the coming years due to normal base and slowdown in the lower-end PV and LCVs, they said.  At 12.45 pm, the stock was trading at Rs 804.35 on the National Stock Exchange, up 1.93 percent from the previous close.

These are L&amp;amp;T, Ultratech Cement, Titan, Bharti Airtel, Adani Ports, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance and RIL","Here is a thought experiment for cricket aficionados. Compare these two statistics and pick the better Test player:  Batsman A -&nbsp; 52 Matches, 80 innings, 6,996 runs.  Batsman B &ndash; 200 matches, 329 innings, 15,921 runs.  Before you make this seemingly straightforward choice, here&rsquo;s another input. These two are not hypothetical cases but real players. The prolific Batsman B with an avalanche of runs is Sachin Tendulkar. And Batsman A&nbsp;is a&nbsp;gentleman named Sir Donald Bradman.  So why is that the overwhelming majority of the cricketing world, including the Little Master himself, picks Batsman A over Batsman B?  The answer lies in another piece of statistic &mdash; average runs per innings.  Bradman&rsquo;s batting average of 99.94 remains the stuff of legends, a feat no other batsman has come close to achieving. Sachin has a test batting average of 53.78, Sunil Gavaskar 51.12 and Brian Lara 52.88.  There have been batsmen who have scored more runs than Bradman, at a faster clip, with the highest top score and with more centuries and half-centuries. But no one has managed to score runs with&nbsp;the dependable regularity of&nbsp;&amp;quot;The Don&amp;quot;.  In other words, the secret sauce of greatness is not one-off outperformance but consistency.  Which brings us to Dalal Street.  The equity benchmark Nifty ended 2023 with robust gains of 20 percent, marking its eight straight year of positive returns.  While 2023 belonged to auto, infrastructure and PSU stocks, which counters consistently outperformed the Nifty during the eight-year period? And which ones were turned out to be duds? Here&rsquo;s what we found:  Bull Run Scorecard  As per a Moneycontrol analysis, eight Nifty stocks have outperformed the index the highest number of times (five) since 2016 &ndash; L&amp;amp;amp;T, Ultratech Cement, Titan, Bharti Airtel, Adani Ports &amp;amp;amp; SEZ, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance and Reliance Industries.  While banks hog the limelight, not one features in this list, which is dominated by capex-related names.    Analysts say this could be the major theme for the Indian market, at least in the medium term.  &ldquo;The broad-basing of India's rising investment cycle is well evident but there is significant headroom here. The capex as&nbsp;a percent of nominal GDP&nbsp;would rise to a nearly decade high of 30% in FY24. We believe though, there is a long way to go in the capex cycle,&rdquo; global brokerage firm Jefferies said in a note.  The recent upturn in corporate spending and housing cycle have around five years to go, it said, adding that L&amp;amp;amp;T, Ultratech, and Coal India are among its preferred capex cycle plays.  Also Read:&nbsp;India rises to 2nd spot in MSCI EM index, firms up stand as investment destination  A finer look at the data offers some more insights.  Bajaj Finance, which was included in the 50-pack Nifty in 2017, topped the index gainers&rsquo; list that year with returns of 108 percent. It went on to top the winners&rsquo; chart for the next two years as well &mdash; a hat-trick no other Nifty constituent scored during the period under review.  Another high-flying stock emerged as a cautionary tale for momentum investors.  Yes Bank was the second biggest Nifty gainer in 2016 with a rise of 59 percent but did a 180-degree turnabout to emerge as the biggest loser in the Nifty pack the next year and in 2019 as well before being removed from the index in March 2020.  Another mercurial member has been Adani Enterprises &ndash; the top Nifty gainer in 2022 (126 percent returns) followed by the biggest loser in 2023 (down 26 percent).  Tata Motors, the only Nifty constituent to have jumped over 100 percent in 2023, has another feather in its cap &ndash; the biggest single-year gain by a Nifty stock in the eight-year period at 162 percent, which it achieved in 2021.  There has also been a heartening reversal in fortunes, this time by a PSU stock, demonstrating perhaps the change in narrative around the sector as a whole.  Coal India finished in the red for five straight years starting 2016. It managed to gain a paltry 8 percent in 2021, while the Nifty vaulted over 24 percent. However, it zoomed to the second position in 2022 with 54 percent returns, followed by a top-five finish the next year at 67 percent gains.  While a number of stocks have underperformed during the period in question, two stick out &ndash; BPCL and UPL, which have ended five of the eight years in losses.

In an interaction with PTI, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Managing Director Shailesh Chandra said the automaker retailed around 53,000 units in November, which was 8 per cent higher as compared to October this year and 30 per cent up as compared to sales in November 2022.  The company also witnessed strong sales performance in the 47 days long festive period this year with registrations of around 79,374 units, up 18 per cent over the same period of last year.  &amp;quot;We had a very strong festive season, which I would attribute mainly to the newly launched facelifted Nexon, Harrier, Safari and the iCNG range. And therefore, our VAHAN registrations, or real sale as we call it, was the highest ever in our history,&amp;quot; Chandra said.  He noted that the passenger vehicle segment is set to record its best ever performance in the current fiscal with the industry expected to cross the 40-lakh cumulative sales mark.  When asked if it could be a record year for Tata Motors as the company in terms of sales, he noted: &amp;quot;Yes, absolutely, for industry as well as for us.&amp;quot; The company's market share in terms of retail sales crossed the 15 per cent-mark last month, Chandra said.  He noted that the company's SUV portfolio led the retail sales growth in the last few months.  Last month, Nexon and Punch were at the top two positions in the SUV segment, Chandra said.  &amp;quot;In terms of overall SUV numbers, we were at number two position last month,&amp;quot; he added.  Led by Tiago and Altroz, the company has also retained second spot in the hatchback segment, Chandra said.  He informed that the company has moved to VAHAN (vehicle registration data), from wholesale figures, as a measure of its sales and market share.  &amp;quot;It is helping us bring about a cultural change in the way people operate at the ground level from the dealer to the sales team. The focus is on demand generation, rather than managing off-take from OEM to dealers,&amp;quot; Chandra said.  On sales outlook post the festive season, he noted that there should be a dip in enquiries as compared with festive period. &amp;quot;But, I am sure that this level of demand should sustain... A strong demand should remain in the range of 3.3-3.5 lakh per month for the PV segment.&amp;quot;  Chandra said the automaker would continue to offer models with multiple engine options ranging from petrol, diesel, CNG and electric vehicles.  &amp;quot;Diesel has completely gone away in the lower segments in hatches and sedans and there it has been substituted with CNG vehicles. And therefore, in this segment CNG becomes an important and good alternative,&amp;quot; he said.  Similarly, compact SUV onwards there is a strong demand for diesel, Chandra said.  &amp;quot;So, we will go with the flow as per the demands in these segments,&amp;quot; he added.","Business, Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/tata-motors-reports-highest-ever-monthly-retail-salesnovember_17367331.html
