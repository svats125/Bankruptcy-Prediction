This is in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 19 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016, it added.  Last month, the lenders of Videocon Industries had approved the bid by Twin Star Technologies, promoted by billionaire Anil Agarwal''s family, under the insolvency resolution process of the debt-ridden firm.  The company, however, did not elaborate on the agenda of the meeting of the consolidated CoC.  On December 16, Videocon Industries in a regulatory informed that the CoC of the company had voted in favour of the resolution plan of Twin Star Technologies, for 13 group companies with 95 per cent votes.  However, the filing did not mention the amount which Twin Star Technologies had offered.  The said resolution plan, as approved by the CoC, has been filed with the National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai in accordance with the Section 30(6) of the Code for its approval on December 15, 2020, it added.  Videocon Industries owes around Rs 31,000 crore to the banks, which also includes interests.  Earlier, the Dhoot family had offered to pay Rs 30,000 crore to lenders to settle their outstanding loans and pull out 13 Videocon group companies from the insolvency proceedings.  A proposal for paying the amount was forwarded to the CoC of the Videocon Industries, under section 12 A of the Insolvency &amp;amp;amp; Bankruptcy Code (IBC).  However, the creditors have chosen Vedanta Group''s offer, which has placed its resolution plan through one of its subsidiary companies.  Vedanta''s interest in Videocon is principally driven by the latter''s 25 per cent stake in the Ravva oil field.  Vedanta, through Cairn, holds 22.5 per cent stake in Ravva and any successful bid by Vedanta will take its stake to 47.5 per cent, and it will be the biggest stakeholder ahead of ONGC''s 40 per cent.  The average output from the Ravva block in 2019-20 was 14,232 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), and it increased to 22,037 boepd in the first quarter of 2020-21.  Dhoot''s settlement offer was made for 13 out of the 15 Videocon group companies, which are jointly going through the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP).  Two group companies -- KAIL and TREND -- were not covered under the offer.","Business, Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/videocon-industries-lenders-12-other-group-companies-to-meet-today-under-irp_14638161.html

The diversified group owes collectively over Rs 1 lakh crore to lenders.,"The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has ordered the inclusion of Videocon Industries' overseas oil and gas business in the ongoing insolvency process being conducted in the country.  Videocon was in the first list of the 12 largest accounts that the Reserve Bank of India referred for bankruptcy in late 2016. The diversified group owes collectively over Rs 1 lakh crore to lenders.  &amp;quot;&hellip;..there is cross creation of the security interest by all lenders in other business assets of Videocon Group treating it as a single economic entity,&amp;quot; NCLT has said.  &amp;quot;... we have concluded that foreign oil and gas assets of the group held through VOVL, VHHL, VEBL and VINI, are in fact, the assets and property of VIL&hellip;. Therefore, the assets held by them can be said to be 'its' assets, which is under the insolvency,&amp;quot; the order noted.  VIL's overseas oil and gas companies are VOVL Ltd, Videocon Hydrocarbon Holdings Ltd (VHHL), Videocon Energy Brasil Ltd (VEBL), Videocon Indonesia Nunukan Inc (VINI).  The tribunal also directed the resolution professional (RP) to include the assets, liabilities, claims of the above mentioned overseas assets/companies in the information memorandum of Videocon Industries.  The two-member bench comprising Suchitra Kanuparthi and Chandra Bhan Singh allowed a moratorium on the foreign petroleum assets of the group which will restrain its lenders from selling the conglomerate's overseas assets.  In addition, the order cited that since some time has passed in deciding the application, the time spent in deciding this application from August 22, 2019 until the date of the order, is added in the permitted timeline for the completion of the ongoing insolvency process.  Venugopal Dhoot had moved NCLT after State Bank of India invited bids in August 2019 for the group's overseas assets, which were offered as collateral for loans to Videocon entities.  The proposed sale was outside the insolvency process of group entities, and lenders, including SBI, had opposed Dhoot's plea.  Dhoot opposed the sale on the grounds that they belonged to Videocon Industries' overseas arms, which were set up as special purpose vehicles to act as trustee and hold the assets on behalf of the parent.  Videocon Industries had jointly applied for acquisition and extended payments for acquisition of overseas assets in 2007.  Lenders opposed Dhoot's application citing that the overseas subsidiaries were the owners of the oil and gas assets. They said Videocon Industries had no rights over the assets. SBI had argued that extension of moratorium to the overseas assets could delay recovery of money from sale of the assets.  Earlier, the NCLT had allowed consolidation of 13 of the 15 Videocon group companies into a single entity in August 2019, based on similarity in operations, debt repayment obligations, management, assets and liabilities and interlacing of financial structure among the Videocon entities.  The tribunal also allowed consolidation of overseas assets based on the same parameters which were framed by it during the consolidation of the insolvency proceedings.  The flagship Videocon Industries' debt stood at Rs 19,506 crore as of March 2018. The group is among the 40 largest defaulters identified by the Reserve Bank's first list for insolvency in late 2016.  The company has its core businesses in consumer electronics and oil &amp;amp;amp; gas exploration, while the subsidiaries are into manufacturing, sale and distribution of consumer goods.  The lenders plan to first auction the electronics business estimated to be worth USD 2 billion.","Business, Companies, NCLT, Videocon Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/nclt-orders-inclusionvideocon39s-overseas-assetsbankruptcy-process_13497621.html

A source told BS that ICICI Bank is looking to settle the matter via the consent route rather than contesting it, while also considering other legal options.

After the notice is served, the party has 60 days to file the plea, which in this case would expire in December.  The bank had until now denied all allegations in the matter, stating that it had been unaware of the alleged conflict of interest in the case. And while the plea does not indicate any admission of wrongdoing, it is, however, a departure from the private lender&rsquo;s previous position.  SEBI&rsquo;s notice is based on a preliminary report, wherein it concluded that there was a conflict of interest in the bank&rsquo;s transactions with Videocon. Chanda Kochhar&rsquo;s failure to disclose her husband&rsquo;s dealings with Videocon and her non-compliance with listing agreement prompted the regulator to begin proceedings.

A senior public sector bank official said, &amp;quot;We will have to write-off the account as nothing is recoverable from the borrower for now. This action had to be taken. If it can get resolved, then we can get some of our money back.&amp;quot;  The debt-ridden company earlier approached the principal bench of NCLT on April 25. It requested the court to direct all insolvency case, to consolidate all multiple insolvency cases filed by lenders at three different courts of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Mumbai and hear them together.  &amp;quot;This process has to be taken in place collectively,&amp;quot; submitted Videocon Industries counsel adding that they all are part of one composite group.  The step-down subsidiaries include Videocon Telecom, Electro World and Millennium Appliances.  Videocon is in the second list of 28 defaulters by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code if a debt resolution plan couldn&rsquo;t be agreed by the end of December 2017.  The principal bench has directed to list immediately the matter once affidavit is filed by Videocon Industries.","Business, Current Affairs, India",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/nclt-admits-videocon-case-for-insolvency-proceedings_10984661.html

The move is aimed at seeking a resolution plan from the companies that cumulatively owe about Rs 13,000 crore. Moneycontrol couldn&rsquo;t independently verify the report.  According to the report, the debts have been grouped into four clusters to help streamline the process. A senior banker told the paper, &ldquo;Petitions have been filed by different banks but these are not yet admitted.&rdquo;  In concerned banks have also appointed four interim resolution professionals (IRPs) &mdash; Divyesh Desai of Singhi Advisors, Mahender Khandelwal of PwC India, Dhushyant Dave, a cost accountant, and Avil Menezes, a chartered accountant.  While the appointments are subject to NCLT&rsquo;s approval, &ldquo;the court is likely to appoint them going by their track records,&rdquo; a person close to the development told the newspaper.  The Videocon group subsidiaries include Century Appliances, Value Industries, Trend Electronics, Sky Appliances and PE Electronics. These subsidiaries are involved in activities such as manufacturing, sale and distribution of consumer goods.  They were both part of the second list of 28 large corporate defaulters issued by the Reserve Bank of India in August last year.  In March, the NCLT had rejected an intervention sought by Videocon against SBI amending its original bankruptcy petition, according to a report by Mint.  The Venugopal Dhoot controlled company had alleged that SBI had made several changes to the original petition, meaning the original plea was defective and hence needed to be rejected.","Business, Companies, IBC, insolvency, NCLT, SBI, Videocon",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/sbi-led-lenders-file-insolvency-petitions-against-videocon-units_10868141.html

Documents available with Moneycontrol show that NuPower Technologies, a 100 percent subsidiary of NuPower Renewables, was bought out by little-known A-One Parts and Services for Rs 116 crore in 2016.  A-One Parts is promoted by Anirudh Bhuwalka. The transaction had taken place even as two of Bhuwalka&rsquo;s other companies, AMW Motors and AMW Auto Component, were struggling to repay debts taken from a consortium of banks.  An e-mail questionnaire sent to Kochhar on April 12 was unanswered at the time of filing this report. Kochhar is battling allegations that Dhoot&rsquo;s decision to sell his stake in NuPower Renewables to the former for a low price was a quid pro quo for loans extended to Videocon Group by ICICI Bank. Deepak is the husband of MD &amp;amp;amp; CEO of ICICI Bank Chanda Kochhar.  In response to a query from Moneycontrol, A-One Parts said: &ldquo;There was an agreement for acquiring shares and debentures in Nupower Technologies for a consideration of 116 crore. Based on this agreement a token advance of Rs 1 crore was paid to NuPower. No further payment has been made since the transaction has not been consummated.&rdquo;  However, the shareholding details of NuPower Technologies for the year ended March 31, 2017 show A-One Parts &amp;amp;amp; Services owning 100 percent of NuPower Technologies.  When this was again pointed out to A-One Parts, it responded saying: &ldquo;We have no knowledge or control over what NuPower has stated in its financial statements. U (sic) can address this with NuPower.&rdquo;  Interestingly, Bhuwalka&rsquo;s firm made the investment in NuPower Technologies when his company AMW Motors was struggling to repay Rs 1,800 crore of loans to a consortium of banks led by IDBI Bank. The company was then put up for sale by the consortium of banks.  A similar problem was faced at group company AMW Auto Component, which owed Rs 724 crore to banks, and was put up for sale in 2017 by the eight lenders who had jointly taken control of the firm.  Nupower Technologies reported losses of Rs 5 crore and Rs 8 crore respectively for financial years 2015-16 and 2016-17.  In FY16, the company had reported a turnover of Rs 43 crore, which plunged to Rs 48 lakh the following year. NuPower Technologies mentioned in its annual report that the losses were due to the closure of the plant due to lack of orders.  Anirudh Bhuwalka owns 84.90 percent in A-One Parts. Close to 15 percent is held by one Mukesh Agarwal. Six other directors jointly with Asia Motorworks Holdings (AMWHL)&nbsp; own 0.02 percent each.  AMWHL is the holding company for AMW Motors, owning 99.99 percent in the company.  A Registrar of Companies (RoC) filing for 2009 shows Essar Investment and Mauritius-based Essar Motorworks Holdings having subscribed Rs 442 crore and Rs 478 crore worth of debentures in AMWHL. The current status of these investments could not be ascertained. In a 2015 filing with RoC, AMWHL has shown long term borrowing of Rs 811.45 crore.

This is the first instance of a bank being charged with a fine of this quantum for non-compliance of this nature.  &amp;quot;ICICI Bank had continued with the sales from HTM category for a few weeks during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, due to a genuine misunderstanding on the timing of the applicability of RBI&rsquo;s direction in this matter,&amp;quot; ICICI Bank said in a clarification on Thursday.  RBI norms require the bank to&nbsp;disclose the market value of HTM investments and specify the difference between book value and market value, if&nbsp;sale of HTM securities exceeds 5&nbsp;percent of overall HTM investments.  &amp;quot;As per RBI guidelines, the bank had disclosed in its annual report for FY2017 that it had sold more than 5&nbsp;percent of investments categorised as HTM. However, the bank had not made the specified additional disclosure at that time,&amp;quot; the private sector lender said.  The bank has&nbsp;been making the specified disclosure in all its financial results since the June quarter last year,&nbsp;it&nbsp;added.  This comes a day after&nbsp;ICICI Bank clarified its stance&nbsp;on its loan exposure to&nbsp;Videocon&nbsp;Group and conflict of interest relating to loans to the bank's CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar's husband's firm NuPower&nbsp;Renewables.  Banks need to disclose the amount of securities they keep under the HTM segment, under which the papers are held until maturity and cannot be used for intraday trading.  At present, RBI allows banks to sell securities from the HTM category, subject to certain limits and disclosure norms.","banking, Business, ICICI Bank, RBI",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/rbi-slaps-rs-589-crore-fineicici-bank-for-failure-to-meet-disclosure-normssalesecurities_10720201.html

They have an exposure of over Rs 20,000 crore that the lenders have to Videocon. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Venugopal Dhoot of Videocon shared his views on the same.  We will be able to pay the bank their loans, it is only a question of time, he said.  Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.  Sonia: If you can just start off by first putting the numbers in front of us what is the exact debt that the company has on the books currently, what is the domestic debt at the moment?  A: Company is having domestic and foreign debt together is only Rs 20,000 crore on Videocon International Limited. We have got another company, sister company Videocon Hydrocarbon Limited which is registered abroad and that company is having Rs 22,000 crore loan, but that loan has been taken from foreign banks. Indian banks has nothing to do with that and even Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has nothing to do there. So, only Rs 19,000 crore loan is taken from Indian bank is in question.  Latha: Just before I came into the interview I was speaking to State Bank of India (SBI) they gave me a figure of close to Rs 50,000 crore and they said half of it is international as you said and half of it is Indian. So, is it is little more than Rs 20,000 crore if you add it all the working capital that is what the bankers say?  A: You see the foreign loan is given by foreign banks and not by Indian banks and that loan is separate. That is in a separate company. So, what resolution they require is only for Rs 20,000 crore.  Latha: Not Rs 24,000 or 25,000 only Rs 20,000?  A: Yes. Rs 20,000 crore resolution has been put by the SBI; working capital is not default. Working capital loan is not under default and no problem is there.  Latha: Even the foreign debt some of it has been given by Indian banks we understand?  A: No, foreign loan has been given by various banks like Deutsche Bank, Bank of England, Bank of America and Standard Chartered Bank, most of majority of loan has been given by them only. Indian bank has got very small loan over there which was taken initially. Since oilfields has been doing very well there is no question of default over there.  Latha: You mean you have been paying all the foreign loan interest?  A: Foreign loan interest has been paid, you see foreign loan is a project loan and project loan interest is provided by the bank only so there is no question of default in the foreign loan.  Sonia: That is a foreign loan, but we are more interested in with what is happening with the Indian loan at the moment that Rs 20,000 crore that you spoke about? What are the haircuts that the bankers will have to take because of the insolvency?  A: Well, when I am there, I am quite sure banks will not be required to take any haircut. Because our brand is very valuable, we are having properties worth around Rs 7,000 crore and we are having lot of other assets also. So, I don&rsquo;t think banks will have to take any haircut in our case and we will also try our level best.  Latha: How can you be in charge under the NCLT the existing promoters are not allowed to buy?  A: We will not be taking, we will be supporting them that other should buy. For example, team led by State Bank of India visited Electrolux and all those people and they are also trying to sell it. Do you know this that NCLT order has not been passed till now. The company is with us only. We have gone to High Court also.  Nisha: Coming to that point, first is of course you have challenged the lenders and you have taken it to NCLT, you don&rsquo;t want to be in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), so if you are challenging that and you are going to go to the Highest court so that you are still in control of your companies, what is your plan B in terms of recovering the funds to pay back the lenders? Which are the assets if you can pinpoint, of course there have been several news point, several transactions that have been announced including Kenstar, Dish TV and many other, so if you can lay down your strategy in terms of repaying the debt to the lenders by selling the valuable assets that you just mentioned?  A: You will understand that Videocon as a going concern with a brand and all other sub brand has got a tremendous value and it has got a largest market share in India. So, there should be many more interest coming over here for this company and we are trying that under any circumstances our banks should not have any haircut. That is our intention, because we think that there is no fault from our side. Our telecom license has been cancelled and that is why we came into this position. But we don&rsquo;t want bank to make any loss.  Latha: On what point have you taken the banks to the High Court?  A: We wanted that our project report is good and our proposal was good and there was no necessary to refer it to NCLT and they can take it again because we have our plan to repay all of our money to the bank. So on this point we have gone and we are quite hopeful that we will be able to convince banks also and the court also that we are solvent company.  Sonia: Are there any interested buyers in any of your assets at the moment?  A: We have got lot of properties, there are interest for buyers for that also. As a going concern for Videocon there are many buyers. I will tell you all of the bankers led by State Bank of India visited various places abroad to search for the buyer and they have also got a very hood response. So, I am quite hopeful that this going concern business of Videocon will have a very big value.  Nisha: Let us take it one by one &ndash; the Dish TV merger plan had been announced that could be really making it to a listed merged entity very soon now that you have got all the proposals. Is there a plan for Videocon to sell their stake in the merged entity to Dish TV, recover some funds out of that and then could that be utilised to repay debt to the banks?  A: You see merger has not taken place yet and after merger will take place we will decide what to do but about merger etc. the authority to talk with Dish management and we don&rsquo;t know anything on that. But merger will take place very soon in 4-5 days&rsquo; time that is what we think. Then we will decide what to do in future.  Sonia: There are other group companies liabilities that you have to repay as well, right? What amount is that exactly? Is it about Rs 5,000-6,000 crore?  A: Which is that?  Sonia: The other group companies liabilities that you have to repay?  A: Group companies &ndash; total liability is Rs 20,000 crore only. Total liability of banks in India is only Rs 20,000 crore.  Latha: What is the progress on the international oil reserves, are you able to start prospecting oil, can you give us a timeline on when you will be able to draw oil and make profits over there?  A: We are quite sure from next year we will start the oil production. We will be able to pay all the money borrowed from oilfield to the bank as it starts production and it has got huge oil. It is one of the largest oil reserve in the world. So, there is no problem for us. To get lot of money out of it at USD 65 it is very viable proposal.  Latha: When is the next hearing in the High Court?  A: That I don&rsquo;t remember, I can&rsquo;t say when it will be. Next date has not been given.  Sonia: By when can we expect the company to come out of NCLT?  A: That depends on the court decision and all, because the matter is sub judice I will not talk on that matter.  Sonia: Ask you about the possibility of Everstone Group acquiring Kenstar I mean there was a lot of talk that Everstone was looking to acquire Kenstar, anything that has come up on that front? Any kind of timeline that we are looking at?  A: As you know when we sell any asset, any brand, anything there is non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and that non-disclosure agreement are very strict, so I would not like to speak on that who is the buyer, who will buy and when they will buy.  Latha: For what all assets do you have buyers, since you have taken the banks to the High Court saying that you can pay them back who are the buyers who have expressed interest and on which assets?  A: We can say that we have got a Videocon brand and with other brand we are having a going concern business and this going concern has got a great value and we can pay money to the bank. Apart from that we are having Rs 7,000 crore worth of properties and looking at all these things we will be able to pay to the bank their loan. Only think is that it is a question of time only.  Latha: What about the insurance arm, how much did you get for the sale?  A: That still has to be decided.  Latha: But you have sold it off, right?  A: There is a formula, formula we are working and we have got a permission to sell from Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) to sell the insurance company.  Latha: Are you selling it to Diamond Deal Trade Limited, it was one of those group companies of Jindal Group and Enam Securities which were wanting to buy?  A: Yes. Price etc. will be decided and the name what you have said is &ndash; that I can&rsquo;t give you just now. Negotiations are going on.  Sonia: What about Kelvinator, the business was expected to be sold, right? Anything on that front that we can expect anytime soon?  A: Kelvinator has been doing very well and it was never expected to be sold. It is doing very well.  Latha: You are expecting to get the Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP) announcement on March 28th, right? That is the next hearing in NCLT?  A: We don&rsquo;t predict about what Court will do and what Court will not do, I can&rsquo;t predict that.  Latha: Since when are you an NPA, I think Dena Bank called you an NPA about one year ago? You have not been servicing interest for the past 9 or 12 months?  A: No, there has been a formula decided by the State Bank of India which we are stilling paying the interest. 7 percent of our revenues goes to the interest account and we are paying the interest.
