Both, the sequential revenue growth and EBIT margin were as per expectation. It reported revenue growth of 0.9% QoQ in USD terms. The cc revenue growth was 0.9% QoQ in cc terms. There was sequential increase in EBIT margin (up 11 bps QoQ) to 17.2%. led by positive operating efficiency. Employee attrition continues to decline as LTM attrition decreased by 90 bps QoQ to 15.8%. The near term demand environment remains challenging as the clients across sectors remain cautious regarding the evolving macroeconomic situation leading to slow decision making and thus impacting near term revenue performance. Improving employee pyramid and falling employee attrition will support operating margin going ahead. We estimate revenue CAGR of 17.1% (including impact of SWC acquisition) over FY23‐26E with average EBIT margin of 18.6%.  Outlook We maintain our NEUTRAL rating on the stock with revised target price of Rs 5,447/share at 31x on FY26E EPS. The stock trades at PER of 34.4x/30.5x on FY25E/FY26E EPS.

The management maintained its FY24 revenue growth guidance at 17.5-18.5%, which implies a strong exit to FY24 (+4.0-7.0% QoQ CC), aided by SWC seasonality. EBIT margin wasflat at 17.2% (up 10bp QoQ), missing our estimate of a 60bp QoQ improvement. Despite the net headcount reduction of ~600, the margin improvement was muted in 3Q as utilization was low due to furloughs and higher SG&amp;amp;amp;A costs.

Positive commentary from the management, hinting at better days ahead, further lifted the sentiment.  At 9.17am, shares of L&amp;amp;amp;T Tech were trading at Rs&nbsp;5,491.50 on the NSE.  The information technology company posted a 14.4 percent on-quarter jump in its consolidated net profit to Rs&nbsp;336.2 crore in Q3, largely in-line with CNBC TV-18 estimate of Rs 332 crore.  The topline grew 1.5 percent sequentially to&nbsp;Rs 2,422 crore. In&nbsp;dollar terms, the revenue stood at $290.7 million for October-December.

The company's&nbsp;management sounded positive, with the CEO quoting that &amp;quot;winter is over, spring is around the corner&amp;quot;. On that account, the company also retained its&nbsp;FY24 growth guidance of 17.5&ndash;18.5 percent, pointing towards a strong Q4.  Deal flows in Q3 also remained strong with six $10-million-plus contracts.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  Hopeful of seeing a turnaround in the coming quarters, Nuvama Institutional Equities raised its&nbsp;FY24/25/26 by 0.2 percent/1.5 percent/3.1&nbsp;percent in anticipation of&nbsp;enhanced revenue visibility for L&amp;amp;amp;T Tech. The firm also upgraded the stock to 'buy' while raising its price target by over 20 percent to Rs&nbsp;6,260.  Motilal Oswal Financial Services also remains positive of the company and believes that with&nbsp;deal activity and pipeline continuing to improve,&nbsp;L&amp;amp;amp;T Tech&nbsp;is likely to gain incremental business from the scale-up in new accounts.  &amp;quot;While Q4 will benefit from seasonal tailwinds in the recently acquired SWC (Software and Consulting) business, the upper end of the guidance indicates an improving near-term outlook, a ramp-up in recent empanelment, and potential large deal wins,&amp;quot; the firm said in a note. MOFSL has a 'buy' call on the stock with a price target of Rs 6,220.  At a contrast, Nomura showed caution as it felt the Q4 ask rate for L&amp;amp;amp;T Tech for achieving its FY24 revenue growth guidance of 17.5-18.5 percent was a steep one. On that account, Nomura retained its 'reduce' call on the stock and inched down its price target to Rs&nbsp;3,880.  On the other hand, Jefferies believes the company would need material acceleration for growth in FY25, in the absence of which, it could underperform.

Though 3QFY23 is expected to remain soft due to furloughs, we expect growth to rebound in 4Q. Despite factoring in demand moderation in 2HFY23, we see the guidance as achievable with strong 1H. This should help LTTS deliver growth near the upper-end of its guidance in FY23E. Though management is highlighting pick up in telecom, media and media devices, large deal wins and inorganic initiatives to help achieve its FY25 aspiration of USD1.5b revenue run-rate, we are building in USD revenue CAGR of 12.9% over FY22-24E, below the run rate required to meet its FY25E revenue aspiration (implying FY22-25E CAGR of 19%).

While, the revenue growth was inline with estimates, EBIT margin came above expectation. It reported constant currency growth of 4.5% QoQ, led by Transportation vertical( up 7.4% QoQ) and Plant Engineering( up 4.6% QoQ). The INR reported growth of 6.5% QoQ was supported by depreciation of INR by 3.4% QoQ vs USD. There was sequential decline in EBIT margin(down 14 bps QoQ) led by impact of wage hike in the quarter(slightly offset by control on other expenses). There was slight increase in reported employee attrition as LTM attrition increased by 90 bps QoQ to 24.1%. The long term demand environment remains intact led by growing outsourcing of ER&amp;amp;amp;D services. However, the clients especially in sectors such as Hitech and Medical devices have become cautious regarding the evolving macroeconomic situation leading to signs of demand softness in these segments and it poses near term risks. Employee attrition is expected to come down in H2FY23 and should support operating margin going ahead. We estimate revenue CAGR of 17.9% over FY22‐24E with average EBIT margin of 18.9%.  Outlook We maintain our NEUTRAL rating on the stock with revised target price of Rs 3,696/share at 28.5x on FY24E EPS. We have slightly increased its target valuation multiple from 27.5x to 28.5x.

Despite the large 400bp shift in its on-site revenue mix and lower utilization (-80bp QoQ), operating margin was flat QoQ. Attrition spiked to 20.4% (+290bp QoQ) in 4QFY22, indicating continued supply pressures. The company bagged its second over USD100m deal (after winning a historical first in Dec&rsquo;21) from Jaunt Air Mobility in the Aerospace vertical. USD CC revenue/INR EBIT/INR PAT grew 20%/52%/44% YoY in FY22. While the management&rsquo;s initial FY23 revenue growth guidance of 13.5-15.5% was disappointing, their vertical commentary and deal momentum (six deals of over USD10m in 4QFY22) suggest that its guidance trajectory should mirror that of FY22 where there was a gap of almost 500bp between its initial guidance and final growth. With the scaling up of new deal wins from 2QFY22 onwards, we remain confident of LTTS delivering a revenue growth of 17.5% in FY23. With continued additions to its workforce (LTTS grew its staff count by 27% in FY22, despite elevated attrition) and an improving deal pipeline, we continue to view the company as a beneficiary of structural demand tailwinds.  Outlook We lower our FY23-24 EPS estimate by 4-5% due to the 4QFY22 miss and weaker guidance. We maintain our Buy rating and marginally tweak our TP to INR5,280 per share (40x FY24E EPS).

Our EPS estimates cut by 3.3%/4.2% in FY23/24 led by cut in revenue estimates. We assume ~18% margins in FY23 &amp;amp;amp; FY24. FY23 USD revenue growth guidance of 13.5-15.5% YoY USD appears to be conservative given pickup in large deal wins especially in EACV segment in FY22 and all-time large deal pipeline. However, given possibility of moderation in ER&amp;amp;amp;D spends due to macro uncertainties, guidance may not be upgraded by same level as it was done in FY22 (upgraded from 13-15% to 19-20%). Management targets to maintain 18%+ EBIT margin factoring in headwinds from intermittent wage hikes, travel costs, high admin expenses partially offset by tailwinds of growth leverage, better quality of revenues, pyramid optimization and operational efficiencies.
