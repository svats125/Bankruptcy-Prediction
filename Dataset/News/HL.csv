Read:&nbsp;Rural demand lag hits FMCG firms in Q3; benign inflation, MSP hike, Budget augur well for recovery  FMCG stocks are underperforming in 2024 following weak Q3 earnings. HUL is down by around 9 percent, ITC by over 12 percent, Nestle India by 4 percent, and Britannia Industries Ltd and Dabur India saw by 8 percent and 2 percent.  Despite falling commodity prices and a robust GDP growth rate, Q3FY24 earnings in the Indian FMCG sector were dampened by sluggish rural demand. Analysts anticipate a rebound in this quarter, driven by economic stimuli for the rural sector, stable macros, and a hike in minimum support price for crops. Despite expectations for rural consumption recovery due to lower commodity prices in 2023, challenges such as erratic rains and pandemic-induced low savings persisted, hindering rural demand.  The FMCG industry grew by 6 percent in volume in the third quarter, with consumption moderating in both urban and rural areas. While lower raw material costs boosted gross margins for FMCG companies, concerns over inflation, an uneven monsoon, and weak rural consumer sentiment contributed to a slowdown in sales.  Mid-sized FMCG firms saw&nbsp;buying by foreign institutional investors. The&nbsp;FII stake in&nbsp;Colgate Palmolive India&nbsp;rose to 24.62&nbsp;percent from 24.08 percent, Procter &amp;amp;amp; Gamble Hygiene and Health Care saw an increase to 1.48 percent from 1.3 percent, and Jubilant FoodWorks&nbsp;recorded a rise to 27.75 percent from 26.14 percent. Adani Wilmar, Gillette India, Relaxo Footwears, Devyani International Ltd, Jyothy Labs, Godfrey Phillips India, Sheela Foam, and Safari Industries India also saw marginal FII stake increases from the last quarter.

The company reported a 2% volume growth (estimate of 2%) and nearly flat revenue growth (estimate of 4%). Volume recovery is being delayed, especially in rural areas, despite price cuts and consumer promotions. The trend of urban growth outpacing rural areas, and the premium segment outperforming the mass market, has continued. The benign raw material inflation continued to drive gross margin (up 400bp YoY, down 100bp QoQ), despite partial benefits being passed on to consumers. The gross profit was up 8% YoY; however, higher A&amp;amp;amp;P (up 35% YoY) offset the benefits and resulted in flat EBITDA. Outlook Management is increasing brand investments to stimulate volume growth in preparation for the volume recovery phase and to counter local competition. Volume recovery is slower than expected so far, but price cuts across categories (mass segment is highly price-sensitive), benign headline inflation, and government&rsquo;s initiatives should aid rural demand in 2024.

The result of which, HUL's homecare and personal care portfolio saw a -1 percent and flat revenue growth in the October-to-December quarter. ","The cycle of local players returning to the market is over by and large, said Rohit Jawa, chief executive officer of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) on January 19.  The fast-moving consumer goods company (FMCG) was facing competition from small and regional players after commodity inflation eased. This was seen mostly in the tea category, where consumers were downgrading to low-priced products.  &amp;quot;We have already taken price corrections wherever needed on price volume optimisation of our brands and now we are almost at the end of the transition cycle,&amp;quot; said Jawa after&nbsp;HUL announced Q3 results.  The company's food and beverage category saw a low-single-digit volume growth because inflation in coffee prices made them take price increases in the portfolio.  ALSO READ: Hindustan Unilever: A tough road ahead to regain volume growth  The management also said that if commodity prices remain where they are, they expect a negative pricing growth from here. FMCG market's value growth in Q2FY24 was around 3 percent which fell to around -1 percent in Q3FY24, as per HUL's investor presentation. While value growth will be negative due to price cuts, the management did not share any outlook on volume growth.  The management said that urban demand has been resilient and leading the overall growth but rural demand is expected to come back in the next few quarters due to better Rabi sowing and strong government support. &amp;quot;We see a sustained but gradual improvement in rural demand,&amp;quot; said Jawa. Urban volumes for the FMCG market increased three percent at two-year CAGR basis in the October-to-December quarter, while rural volumes increased one percent in the same period.  Distributors  HUL said that they revamped their margin model to benefit distributors, which aims to be a 'win-win', ensuring distributors earn more for their efforts while the company sees increased growth. &ldquo;So there's not just a high earning potential but a high earning realized and that's the reason why we have now scaled it to the top 100 cities over the last three months&rdquo; said Jawa.  Earlier this month, the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation had said that they are halting stocking of HUL's products after it changed its margin structure. HUL has cut its distributor margins by 3.9 percent to 3.3 percent in early January.  Market share  The company said that 60 percent of their business is gaining market share, down from 70-75 percent due to inflation in the mass segment in categories like laundry detergent. &ldquo;60 percent plus is a very healthy level of competitiveness from a business perspective, given the amount of continued investment,&rdquo; said Ritesh Tiwari, CFO, Hindustan Unilever.  Premiumisation  HUL said that it is seeing a double-digit volume growth in its new premium products launched recently. &amp;quot;We are seeing response to the premium portfolio and we are stepping up innovation and leaning more to expansion in that space,&amp;quot; said Tiwari.  HUL reported a standalone net profit of Rs 2,519 crore for the December quarter of FY24, registering an increase of just 0.55 percent YoY. While the revenue of the company was at Rs 14,928 crore, falling 0.38 percent YoY.

It reported 0.6 percent fall in revenue sequentially from Rs 15,027 crore in the previous quarter.  &amp;quot;Looking forward we expect gradual recovery in market demand to continue aided by increased Government spending, recovery in winter crop sowing and better crop realization.

However, when assessed on a 2-year CAGR basis, the business exhibited robust double-digit growth of 14 percent with high single digit UVG. Fabric Wash volumes experienced mid-single digit YoY growth, primarily due to the strong performance in the premium portfolio. Household care volumes also increased in the low single digit, primarily driven by Dishwash.  Revenue in Beauty &amp;amp;amp; Personal Care remained steady, marked by mid-single digit UVG. The decline in Skin Cleansing revenue was attributed to price reductions aimed at passing on the benefits of lower commodity costs to consumers. Market development efforts in body wash proved successful. Skin Care performance was affected by a delayed winter in the quarter, but the premium non-winter portfolio maintained strong performance.

Hindustan Unilever's Q3 net profit is expected to be flat year-on-year at Rs 2,678 crore, an average of polls of six brokerage firms says. Revenue, too, is expected flat at Rs 15,414 crore when the FMCG major announces its results on January 19.    HUL&rsquo;s EBITDA margin is expected to increase 77 basis points to 24.1 percent. Brokerages expect a 470 basis points YoY increase in gross margins as input costs like palm oil, tea, and coffee declined.  EBITDA is short for earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation. One basis points is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  Volumes have remained weak for the&nbsp;lifebuoy and Dove manufacturer&nbsp;since the September quarter of the previous financial year, ranging from 2-5 percent.

Also read:&nbsp;Why HUL is not an analyst darling at the moment  The price of palm oil, an essential raw material for the FMCG sector, fell fallen 10 percent YoY and 3 percent QoQ in the December quarter, Kotak Institutional Equities said. Palm Oil is used in making soaps, shampoos, biscuits, and other products.  Domestic tea prices likely fell 4 percent YoY and QoQ in the October-December period, while sugar went up 11 percent and 6 percent , respectively, the brokerage firm said.  In its last earnings call,&nbsp;HUL said it was facing competition from local players in the tea and laundry categories. Tea prices have fallen further, which may lead to increased competition, analysts say. In a situation of easing inflation, small players start entering the market and gain market share from big and listed players.

During the quarter, volumes grew 3% YoY vs. expectation of 7% growth, as higher inflation is adversely impacting consumer spending. In 1QFY24, rural market delivered volume growth. While we expect this momentum to continue; however weather patterns remain a critical factor to monitor. The company is normalizing A&amp;amp;amp;P spends to revive volume and bring it back to pre-COVID levels, which represents 9.8% of sales. Management mentioned about funnelling the gross margin expansion towards adspends to drive volume growth. However, the 120bp YoY increase in &lsquo;other expenses&rsquo; is due to a step-up in investments, the impact of new royalty incentives, and favorable benefits in the base quarter.

Although 73% of sales (HPC) are growing volumes in mid-single digits, market dynamics &amp;amp;amp; trade and consumer inventory will enable gradual increase in volume growth. Although rural markets appear to have bottomed out, erratic weather conditions can increase inflation in daily use items and impact volume recovery. Although long term growth story led by lower penetration and superior value proposition remains, near term pressure on growth can&rsquo;t be ruled out. We expect GM/EBITDAM improvement of 460/100bps over FY23-25 as benefits of lower RM will be partly neutralized by higher ad spends, royalty and lower operating income due to closure of marketing agreement with GSK Asia (Eno, Iodex, Crocin and Sensodyne) post Oct23.

Home care &amp;amp;amp; BPC saw midsingle-digit volume growth while F&amp;amp;amp;R volumes were flat.

In the near term, in a stable commodity scenario, growth will largely be volume led with pricing remaining flattish to slightly negative.

The brokerage firm said that volumes were at a five-quarter low as food segment sales remained weak in Q1FY24. It further said that volume growth will be gradual for HUL, and outlook is cautious as recovery will take time due to macro-headwinds.  Morgan Stanley maintained an equal-weight rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2408.

The firm further said that there would be gradual recovery in consumer demand over the next two-to-three quarters.  HSBC has a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2950. The brokerage firm said that Q1FY24 volumes were low on account of channel destocking and expanding advertising and promotional spends.

Speaking about strategies, Jawa said that successful strategies should not change with every leader, rather they must try to widen the opportunities and keep discipline and focus.

The F&amp;amp;R segment saw near flat volume growth, as consumers downgraded from premium tea to loose tea.","Hindustan Unilever, on July 20, said that if commodity prices remain where they are, its price growth will be flattish-to-negative in the coming quarters. The company expects topline growth to be purely volume-led in the next 2-3 quarters.  Fast-moving consumer goods companies take price hikes when raw material costs spike. This helped HUL post double-digit sales growth till Q4 FY23.  Now that input costs have tempered down after the sharp surge during the Ukraine-Russia war, HUL has been passing on the benefit to consumers by cutting prices. HUL's pricing actions have mainly come in the personal care and home care portfolio, i.e., soaps and detergents.  For the quarter ended June 2023, HUL reported a standalone net profit of Rs 2,472 crore, up 8 percent year-on-year. Revenue grew 7 percent YoY to Rs 15,333 crore, of which 3 percent was volume growth, and the rest was price-led.  However, the 3 percent volume growth was below Street expectations of 5-6 percent. &amp;quot;Consumption usually recovers after a lag when we are coming out of tough times. That said, we are laser-focused on volume growth,&amp;quot; said Rohit Jawa, chief executive officer, and managing director of HUL. Jawa took over as the top boss of India's largest consumer company on June 27.  Breaking down the volume growth in different categories, Ritesh Tiwari, chief financial officer of HUL, explained that home care, as well as BPC (beauty and personal care categories), saw mid-single-digit volume growth. It was the food and refreshment portfolio that dragged down overall volumes. The F&amp;amp;amp;R segment saw near-flat volume growth as consumers downgraded from premium tea to loose tea.  Focus on volumes  To focus on volumes, the company is looking at increasing penetration&nbsp;in categories such as health and well-being, health food drinks (HFD) and masstige. Masstige stands for mass-produced, relatively inexpensive goods that are marketed as luxurious or prestigious.  &amp;quot;It is not that HUL has&nbsp;under-penetration in these categories. The market itself has to be developed first,&amp;quot; explained Tiwari in a press conference.  To this, Jawa added that&nbsp;HUL is over-indexed on premium products, which contributes one-third of the top line. &amp;quot;This segment is growing at least 50 percent faster,&amp;quot; he said.  In the masstige category, HUL scaled up the reach of some Love Beauty and Planet, and Simple. The company took Simple to offline shops as well. Meanwhile, in the HFD category, Boost was taken nationally.  Rural demand  For HUL, rural volume growth finally turned positive in the June quarter, albeit on a soft base. &amp;quot;Weather-related risks continue and El-Nino's impact on inflation and rural demand has to be monitored. However, increased government capex and growing remittances keeps us positive on rural demand,&amp;quot; said Tiwari.  To ensure sustainable volume growth in rural markets, HUL continues to play the price-value equation.&nbsp;This comes at a time when&nbsp;small, regional players have re-emerged in select categories like tea and detergent bars.  The bottom line is the company remains positive that volume growth will drive topline in coming quarters as the trade channels gradually de-stock all high-price inventory. As low-price inventory comes on shelves, they expect volumes to increase.  &amp;quot;Competitive volume growth is our goal,&amp;quot; said Jawa.","Hindustan Unilever, Results",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/hul-expects-price-growth-to-be-flat-or-negativecoming-quarters-all-eyesvolumes_17122311.html
