Surrender value refers to the cash value that an insurance policyholder is entitled to receive if they decide to terminate or surrender their life insurance policy before its maturity or before the insured event occurs.

IRDAI's suggestion to hike surrender values and cut surrender charges caused a concern among life insurance companies. Brokerages had estimated a 400-500 basis points (bps) hit on the margins for life insurance companies.

Going ahead, analysts believe that execution and regulatory proposal outcomes will be key for the life insurer.

Analysts believe the demand for higher-ticket size policies&nbsp;was subdued during the quarter owing to taxation changes.  As a result, APE declined 2 percent YoY in Q3FY24. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said that a likely slowdown in earnings growth at its parent HDFC Bank may have impacted APE growth for the insurer.  That apart, the life insurer's VNB - the present value of future profit associated with new business fell 2 percent YoY in the December-ended quarter, thereby resulting in a marginal contraction of VNB margins to 26.8 percent.

The integration of Exide Life post the merger and synergy accretion is progressing well and management reiterated its guidance of FY23 VNB margin of the merged entity to be at par with pre-merger VNB margin of HDFC Life. On the product side, credit life maintained its strong run with +52% YoY growth, while retail protection appears to be turning the corner with 13% QoQ growth in Q3FY23. On the distribution front, banca and agency both contributed to the company&rsquo;s robust growth. Considering Exide Life&rsquo;s existing cost structure and increased cost in customer acquisition in open architecture, banca channels have resulted in a slightly elevated cost structure for the company. Overall, 9MFY23 developments at HDFC Life come on anticipated lines and, with the Exide Life merger behind, the company is on track to deliver profitable growth. Outlook However, besides HDFC Life&rsquo;s operating performance, the merger process and modalities of the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger are likely to be the key drivers for HDFC Life&rsquo;s shares in the near term.

For the December quarter, the value of the new business was Rs 875 crore, beating street expectations.&nbsp;The average of estimates by three brokerages expected the private-sector life insurer to report the value of new business (VNB) at Rs 861 crore, up 13 percent year on year.  For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022, the value of new business was Rs 2163 crore, more than double that of Rs 923 for the corresponding period a year ago.  For life insurance companies, key profitability metrics are VNB, which captures profitability from total business in a given period, and new business margin (NBM) that tells investors how much a company can squeeze out of each policy written.  VNB is used to measure the profitability of new business written in a period. NBM is a system used by insurers to measure the cost of and profit from writing new policies.  HDFC Life's VNB growth was driven by new business expansion and margins. &amp;quot;We have doubled our VNB in the past and we would like it to be in 18-20 percent growth range,&amp;quot; the company's chief financial officer&nbsp;Niraj Shah said.  Business growth  First-year premiums grew by a strong 29 percent to Rs 2,724.87 crore for the quarter from Rs 2,115.97 crore in&nbsp;the&nbsp;year-ago period.  The&nbsp;retail business grew 17 percent, faster than the broad industry growth. On an annualised premium equivalent basis, business growth was 25.5 percent year-on-year.  Growth in premiums was strong across categories. The life insurer's annuity business grew by over 50 percent, albeit on a low base.  Protection business showed a healthy growth of&nbsp;24.7 percent, though retail protection still remained modest. Shah said that the retail protection business has seen sequential growth and expects the momentum to pick up in the coming quarters. HDFC Life's retail protection growth has decelerated in the past and its share stands at 4 percent.  Growth levers for the life insurer are intact with multiple tie-ups with bank partners, Shah said. The company is targeting Tier 2 and 3 centres for growth, he added, explaining the rationale behind tie-ups with small finance banks and payment banks.  The new business margin for the quarter was 26.8 percent and for the nine-month period 26.5 percent, steady from a year ago.  Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher said that despite the shift in product mix towards margin-friendly non-participatory products, margins have not moved up.&nbsp;Shah said the insurer aims to maintain margins at the current levels in FY24 too.","HDFC Life, Results",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/hdfc-life-q3-net-profit15-valuenew-business-beats-expectation_16815581.html
