The collective wealth of India&rsquo;s billionaires, according to the Forbes World Billionaires 2020 List, contracted 22.8 percent to $312.6 billion from $405.3 billion a year earlier. Forbes calculated net worth based on stock prices and exchange rates as on March 18.  Reliance Industries&rsquo; (RIL) owner Mukesh Ambani continued to hold his position as India&rsquo;s richest, but saw his wealth fall by over 25 percent to $36.8 billion, from $50 billion last year due to stock market collapses and global oil fluctuations. (RIL is the owner of Network 18, publisher of Forbes India.)  However, Ambani has since stormed back into the top 10 of the&nbsp;Forbes real-time Billionaires Index (as of June 26), on the back of 11 large investments into its telecom subsidiary Jio Platforms, which has led to a surge in the RIL stock price and helped make it debt-free.  At least 15 billionaires from the list have seen a growth in net worth from last year. Radhakishan Damani jumped to become the second richest Indian billionaire from seventh in 2019 (net worth up by 24 percent to $13.8 billion), through his Avenue Supermarts which owns and operates the DMart chain of hypermarkets.  Other gainers include Sunil Mittal, whose net worth rose by 35 percent to $8.8 billion in the list, as its telecom service Bharti Airtel has emerged a force to reckon with. Industrialist Gautam Adani, who leads the diversified Adani Group, food and beverages tycoon Ravi Jaipuria and Shree Cement founder Benu Gopal Bangur also gained in net worth from the previous year.  Once math tutor and now entrepreneur Byju Raveendran (in picture) debuts on the list (53rd richest Indian and ranked 1,196) on the back of sharp growth of his edtech unicorn Byju&rsquo;s. According to the list, the company is valued at $8 billion and Raveendran, India&rsquo;s youngest billionaire at 38, at $1.8 billion. (In June-end, Byju&rsquo;s raised about $100 million from Silicon Valley investor Bond Capital, sending its valuation soaring at around $10.5 billion.)  The net worth of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, India&rsquo;s second richest billionaire as per the 2019 list, has fallen 73 percent to $6.1 billion and rank to tenth, as he has been giving away most of his wealth to his charity foundation.  The number of India&rsquo;s dollar billionaires in the list fell by four to 102, which included Ambani&rsquo;s younger brother Anil (75th Indian and 1,349 on the 2019 list). Anil Ambani has seen his businesses crumble, with RCom filing for bankruptcy last year. Media tycoon Subhash Chandra (51st Indian and 916 in 2019) has also fallen off due to debts.  For some, stock market fortunes and business cycles continue to be harsh. Former Yes Bank shareholders Rana Kapoor and Madhu Kapur; Tarang Jain, owner of auto-part maker Varroc, and Max Group&rsquo;s chairman Analjit Singh, who had dropped out in 2019, have not climbed back onto the list. The current fiscal is bound to throw up more unpleasant news. The impact of COVID-19 has only worsened since the list was published and it will hurt valuations of companies more in the coming quarters.

The company sued RCom and its promoter Anil Ambani to recover dues of about Rs 1,500 crore, of which it managed to receive only Rs 550 crore.  &amp;quot;We think fairness sort of came true in the end. But of course, as we sell new deals...we try to avoid those things. But it is hard to tell because who could have seen that coming. That was a tough period,&amp;quot; Peter Laurin, senior vice president and head of business area managed services at Ericsson told PTI.  He was responding to a question whether the company is planning to bring any change in business provisions following the RCom issue.  Ericsson signed managed services contract with RCom after Chinese telecom gear maker Huawei stopped services to the debt-ridden telecom operator because of payment issues.  However, experts feel that Ericsson may have to deposit the amount back in trust and retentionship account.  The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on April 30 allowed insolvency proceedings against RCom after the Anil Ambani-led firm withdrew a challenge to such a move.  &amp;quot;The immediate fallout of IBC proceedings would be that the payment of Rs 550 crore made by RCom to Ericsson would be questioned by the financial creditors.  &amp;quot;Under IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code), no payment can be made to any creditor, much less an operational creditor during CIRP (Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process),&amp;quot; Punit Dutt Tyagi, Partner, Lakshmikumaran &amp;amp;amp; Sridharan &nbsp;said.  He said the payment to Ericsson has been made during CIRP, and that too pursuant to the proceedings under IBC, it is quite likely that Committee of Creditors/NCLT may ask Ericsson to deposit the amount with the resolution professional.  The Swedish firm posted decline in sales contribution from India in the first quarter of 2019 to 4 per cent compared to 6 per cent recorded in the same period a year ago.  Laurin said India is very important for managed services business of Ericsson but at the same time it is complex and a demanding market too.  &ldquo;India is super important. It is important for two reasons. It is important because we have some of our largest customers here. We are doing a lot of managed services for both Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. With lot of operations, it is very complex and very demanding market too,&rdquo; he said.  With around 25,000 employees, Ericsson has the largest employee base in India and largest offshore site for managed services.  Laurin said Ericsson is now placing a lot of trust on Indian engineers because of their competency.  &ldquo;We are putting a lot of trust in Indian engineers who are operating these networks on behalf of our customers worldwide. We have four centres worldwide with India being the biggest, the others being Romania, Mexico and China.  &amp;quot;We are increasing our focus on India as a hub for our managed services. It is not only about labour, which was a big thing in past. Now it is very much about competence and about accessing great engineers with great capabilities,&amp;quot; he said.  The company has plans to hire 300 data scientists in India, Sweden, and Silicon Valley (the US) together as it looks to upscale its capacity in the field of artificial intelligence.  &ldquo;We are interviewing now for India. We believe that half of that 300 will be in India,&rdquo; Laurin said.

Under the deal, Ericsson to manage services of wireline and wireless network for RCom covering more than 100,000 km of fiber and mobile infrastructure in 11 telecom circles, across North and West of India including Delhi and Mumbai.  2016 -- Relations sour on non-paid dues  The relationship between the two companies stays smooth for about three years, but 2016 onward things start to sour as RCom struggles to pay Ericsson on time. Ericsson alleges Reliance defaulted on payments, even after several assurances.  September 2017 - Ericsson terminates MSA, approaches NCLT  Ericsson issues notice for termination of the MSA, stating that RCom breached the agreement by not paying its dues. In the same month, Ericsson approaches the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to recover dues worth over Rs 1,100 crore from RCom.  May 2018 - NCLT initiates insolvency, RCom agrees to pay Rs 550 crore  NCLT accepts a petition of Ericsson and initiates insolvency proceedings. This comes at a time when RCom is trying to sell spectrum, towers and fiber assets to Reliance Jio, the company owned by Ambani&rsquo;s older brother Mukesh Ambani for $3.7 billion to reduce the $7 billion debt load on its books.  On May 29, RCom offers an upfront payment of Rs 550 crore to Ericsson, as a settlement, on condition that Ericsson withdraws the insolvency application. Anil Ambani gives a personal guarantee for the payment to Ericsson.  August 2018 - Matter reaches Supreme Court  On August 3, the matter reaches the Supreme Court which orders RCom to pay Rs 550 crore to Ericsson towards the dues&nbsp;by&nbsp;September 30.  Sept-Oct 2018 -- RCom fails to comply, Ericcson files a contempt petition  RCom misses the September 30 deadline and seeks an extension of the deadline by 60 days from Ericsson. Ericsson refuses and files contempt of court petition in the Supreme Court against Anil Ambani. RCom moves the court for an extension of the deadline, but the plea is dismissed.  February 2019 - Supreme Court sets March 19 deadline to pay  The Supreme Court holds Anil Ambani and three RCom companies guilty of contempt of court for not complying with the undertaking to settle the Rs 550 crores dues of Ericsson.  The Court grants an opportunity to Anil Ambani to overcome contempt by paying Ericsson the balance amount after deducting the Rs 118 crore already deposited in the Court.  The Court sets March 19 as the deadline and says a&nbsp;default would result in Ambani facing three months imprisonment.  March 2019 - Anil Ambani pays Rs 462 crore, avoids a jail term  Mukesh Ambani bails out his younger brother by providing a Rs 462 crore lifeline. Anil Ambani pays the final instalment just a day before the Supreme Court deadline and avoids a potential jail term.

A bench of Justices R F Nariman and Vineet Saran on February 13 reserved its judgement when Ericsson India had alleged that the Reliance Group has money to invest in the Rafale jet deal but they were unable to clear its Rs 550-crore dues, a charge which was vehemently denied by the Anil Ambani-led company.  Ambani told the top court that with the failure of its assets sale deal with elder brother Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio his company has entered insolvency proceedings and is not in control of the funds.  Reliance Communications (RCom) had told the court they had tried to move &amp;quot;heaven and earth&amp;quot; to ensure Ericsson gets its due but was unable to do so due to failure of assets sale deal with Jio.
