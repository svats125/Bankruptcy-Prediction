The company said that the net profit was adjusted for net of fair value gain accounted by Aditya Birla Capital Limited post-acquisition of 9.99% stake by ADIA entities in Aditya Birla Health Insurance.  Shares of the cement maker was up 4.65% at Rs 2,155 in the afternoon trading on Friday.&nbsp; Profit growth on comparable basis was driven by strong demand for the building material amid heavy infrastructure spending.  The reported net profit of the company, however, declined 40 per cent&nbsp;from Rs 2,515.78 crore&nbsp;amid weakness in chemicals unit.  Consolidated revenue came in at Rs 31,965 crore, up 11.6 percent from Rs&nbsp;28,638 &nbsp;crore in the corresponding quarter last fiscal, Grasim Industries&nbsp; said in an exchange notification.  Standalone revenue stood at Rs 6,400 crore and EBITDA at Rs 643 crore, up by 3.2 percent and 11 percent YoY, respectively. &amp;quot;Lower realisations in Caustic Soda business impacted the overall standalone performance,&amp;quot; Grasim said.  Cement sales are likely to rise amid increased government spending on infrastructure, rural development and rising demand from the housing sector. India&rsquo;s cement demand is expected to grow by 6 percent to 8 percent over the next few years, Fitch Ratings said in a report in September 2023.  Demand for cement slowed in December due to elections in four states, flooding in some southern states and a ban on construction to curb air pollution. Although the prices dipped in the October-December quarter, lower fuel and raw material prices helped the cement maker to protect margins.  Last month, Aditya Birla-owned UltraTech Cement&nbsp;&nbsp;posted a&nbsp; a 67 percent surge in net profit in the third quarter of FY24, beating expectations, riding on the back of robust demand for the building materials and lower operating costs.  Grasim's capex for the quarter stood at Rs 1,425 crore, of which Rs 1,088 crore was for the paints business.  Viscose Business  Viscose business reported revenue of Rs 3,715 crore and EBITDA of Rs 402 crore for Q3FY24 up 17% and 535% YoY respectively, though sequentially down by 4% and 14% respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;EBITDA margins improved YoY on the back of higher sales volume and a reduction in input prices.  &amp;quot;China VSF Inventory levels have reduced to 10 days in Q3FY24 compared to 12 days in the previous quarter reflecting a marginal increase in demand. However global demand remained weak from the major consuming markets in US/Europe leading to decrease in prices of the fibre basket,&amp;quot; the company said.  Chemicals Business  Revenue at its second-largest segment, the chemicals business, came at Rs 1,996 crore, was flat on QoQ basis and down 23% YoY.&nbsp; EBITDA for the quarter was up 12% QoQ to Rs 264 crore (down 46% YoY) on the back of improved performance of chlorine derivatives business.  Caustic Soda spot prices&nbsp;improved to ~$488/ton in Oct&rsquo;23 but the quarter exit prices were at ~$423/ton, the company said.  In the second quarter, Grasim's results took a hit amid declining prices in the chemicals business. The company noted oversupply in the domestic market of caustic soda and lower realisations in line with sharp decline in global prices impacted the overall standalone performance.

","Aditya Birla Group flagship&nbsp;UltraTech Cement&nbsp;looks to drive down its debt as cash flow improved on sustained robust demand for building materials, Chief Financial Officer&nbsp;Atul Daga told analysts.  As of December 31, 2023, net debt of the company stood at Rs&nbsp;5,541 crore. The cement maker, which booked&nbsp;a 67 percent surge in Q3 net profit, said that its net debt position marginally increased by the end of December 2023 due to increase in capex cashflow and working capital.  &amp;quot;This year, our capex cash flow will exceed our initial estimate, which we have outlined, and we will spend around Rs 9,000 crore. Next year, too, we could see our cash flows on capex being around Rs 9,000 crore. Working capital has taken up some opportunistic bets on purchase of coal and pet coke,&amp;quot; Daga said&nbsp;in an analysts call.  The analysts call was held on January 19, but its recording and transcript was made available only earlier this week.  UltraTech is confident of the demand and sees utilisation rate in the 80-85 percent range in the fourth quarter, up than 77 percent in the third quarter. &amp;quot;The Q4 will be a high throughput quarter, we should be seeing a further improvement in our cash flows and shrinking net debt... We are working towards reaching a zero net debt position by the end of March 2025,&amp;quot; Daga said.  The cement major's&nbsp;profit climbed to Rs 1,774.78 crore in the three months ended December 2023 from Rs 1,062.58 crore a year earlier, revenue from operations climbed 7 percent to Rs 16,739.97 crore. Lower input costs helped the company protect its margins.  Expansion plans&nbsp;  The company&nbsp;said in November that it would acquire the cement business of the BK Birla Group's Kesoram Industries in an all-stock deal in a bid to expand its capacity amid intense competition for market share in the cement business.  &amp;quot;The effective date of merger has been kept on April 1, 2024. And, as and when the merger gets completed, the numbers will be consolidated with retrospective effect once all regulatory approvals are in place,&amp;quot;&nbsp;Daga said.  Asked if the company is pursuing more inorganic purchases, he said: &amp;quot;Inorganic is always opportunistic and each transaction has to be examined on its fitment with UltraTech given the fact that we are pretty densely present in the country.&amp;quot;  &amp;amp;nbsp;",", Denave, Business, UltraTech",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ultratech-cement-aims-for-zero-net-debt-status-by-end-fy25_17427521.html

All these stocks have surged between 20-40 percent over the last one year","Shares of Cement stocks such as UltraTech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cement, Dalmia Bharat&nbsp;and&nbsp;Shree Cement will be in focus ahead of the interim Budget to be announced on February 1. All these stocks have surged between 20-40 percent over the last one year.  Cement demand surged post-COVID recovery, driven by government spending and housing revival, leading to higher sales and prices in FY2024. Margins are set to rise as input costs have fallen for both the December quarter and the full year, analysts said.  For the year ahead, cement firms are expecting a combination of strong demand and benign input costs to drive profitability. Analysts are pencilling in a 300-350 bps expansion in operating margins to 16.5-18.5 percent as prices of two key raw materials &mdash; pet coke and coal &mdash; have cooled down significantly.  Also Read:&nbsp;15 budget-sensitive stocks to watch today  At the same time, there are concerns about potential oversupply, given the industry's capacity addition of 119 mtpa in the last five years, reaching 595 mtpa. Another 150-160 mtpa is expected in the next five years, of which 35-40 mt will be in this fiscal itself.  Continued government emphasis on infrastructure and housing incentives in the Interim Budget could have a multiplier effect, particularly on cement. Analysts stress that the impact relies heavily on demand from affordable housing, which exhibited a soft trend in the past two to three quarters.  &amp;quot;Amidst robust infrastructure development, we anticipate strong cement demand, spurred by budget increases in housing, roads, railways, and rural projects, and further boosted by initiatives like PMA,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Arun Shukla, President and Director, JK Lakshmi Cement.  Cement makers are hoping that the government will take steps to address rising input costs through lower GST rates and easing import duties on key materials like coal and petcoke.  Budget expectations  Stakeholders eagerly await the FY25 target for government capital spending, a key driver of economic growth. PM Modi, at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit, outlined a vision for robust infrastructure growth, signaling potential policies and incentives in the Interim Budget 2024. Analysts suggest these measures could spur substantial development in the infrastructure sector.  Recently, Moneycontrol reported a Ministry request for a Rs 3.25 lakh crore budgetary allocation for FY 2024-25, a 25 percent YoY increase, aiming to reduce market borrowings for the National Highways Authority of India. In the FY24 budget, the finance minister allocated Rs 10 lakh crore for infrastructure capital expenditure, a 33 percent increase. The industry expects heightened government focus on safety and timely infrastructure upgrades.  Also Read:&nbsp;Consumer durable industry wants GST reduction, Infra push, PLI extension this interim budget  Analysts anticipate a potential boost in budget allocations for housing and infrastructure projects, constituting over 80 percent of India's cement demand. Schemes targeting rural economic revival are expected to drive demand for rural housing. Key points to watch include changes in freight rates and announcements regarding new freight corridors.  &amp;quot;We look forward to witnessing measures aligning with India's growth trajectory, particularly in infrastructure development and affordable housing. An emphasis on maintaining competitive prices for raw materials and energy sources will significantly boost the Indian cement sector. We also remain hopeful of receiving sustained support through fiscal incentives and streamlined freight mechanisms, essential for thrusting the cement industry forward. Additionally, a user-friendly and incentivised renewable energy policy will play a critical role in fostering sustainable growth&amp;quot;, said Jayakumar Krishnaswamy, Managing Director, Nuvoco Vistas Corp.

Antique Stock Broking and Motilal Oswal Securities have retained their 'buy' ratings, while CLSA has maintained an 'outperform' tag on the UltraTech stock. While Antique increased its target price to Rs 11,200 from Rs 10,095 a share, Motilal Oswal Securities raised&nbsp;the target price to Rs 12,000, up 19 percent, and CLSA increased it to Rs 11,020, up 9 percent from earlier target.  UltraTech Cement, part of the Aditya Birla Group, reported a 68&nbsp;percent on-year increase in net profit for the October-December quarter at Rs 1,777 crore on the back of higher volume and lower costs. Revenue rose 8&nbsp;percent on-year to Rs 16,740 crore.  The UltraTech results exceeded analyst expectations with an Ebitda of Rs 3,250 crore (up 39&nbsp;percent YoY). Despite a 5&nbsp;percent on-year&nbsp;increase in volume and 77&nbsp;percent utilisation, industry-wide demand softened 3-4&nbsp;percent on-year, particularly in the North and East due to National Green Tribunal ban, labour/sand shortage, and festivities.  UltraTech has expanded into Jharkhand by acquiring 0.54-MTPA grinding capacity from Burnpur Cements for approximately Rs 170 crore, bringing its total domestic grey cement capacity to around 133MTPA. The FY24 capex guidance has been raised from Rs 6,000-7,000 crore to Rs 9,000 crore. In addition, the company plans to acquire Kesoram Industries (with a cement capacity of 10.75MTPA) for an estimated EV of around Rs 7,500 crore. After completing Phase II capex (at Rs 12,000 crore), UltraTech Cement will reach approximately 157MTPA capacity by the end of FY25.  It has also revealed Phase III capex plans (with an outlay of Rs 13,000 crore), aiming to achieve a capacity of around 179MTPA by FY27, excluding Kesoram's assets.  Anticipating demand recovery in Q4 with high-single-digit growth, CLSA expects continued faster-than-industry growth, projecting an 11&nbsp;percent CAGR in FY23-26, supported by capacity expansion.  Here&rsquo;s what brokerages say about valuation, returns, capex, more  &amp;quot;Ongoing expansions will take UltraTech&rsquo;s capacity from 135&nbsp;tonnes to 179&nbsp;tonnes, while Kesoram acquisition (link) would add 10&nbsp;tonnes. Capex at $72&nbsp;per&nbsp;tonne&nbsp;would generate 15&nbsp;percent IRR per UTCEM which, we believe, implies Rs 1,300&nbsp;per&nbsp;tonne Ebitda at 85&nbsp;percent utilisation and Ebitda&nbsp;per tonne of Rs 1,300. It has guided for a capex of Rs 90&nbsp;billion each in FY24-25, after which Rs 7&nbsp;billion will be pending for ongoing expansion,&amp;quot; CLSA said in its note.  &amp;quot;We value UltraTech at 15.5x March&nbsp;2026 EV/Ebitda, in line with the historical average.

Market leadership, strong growth visibility, and a diversified regional presence that helps balance adverse regional issues should support earnings. We believe UltraTech is best-positioned among the large-cap cement companies. However, our lower-than-historical median multiple reflects increased competition in the sector (with Adani entering) and lower utilisations, leading to lower pricing power,&rdquo; the CLSA report added.

Expecting continued margin improvement in the next few years, the brokerage anticipates a positive industry re-rating&nbsp;with&nbsp;continued outperformance by the stock for the next 12 months.  The brokerage firm retained the 'overweight' tag on UltraTech Cement, Dalmia Bharat, and Grasim Industries,&nbsp;while&nbsp;Shree Cement&nbsp;stayed in the 'equal weight' group. Ambuja Cement and ACC were upgraded to 'overweight' and 'equal weight'.  Morgan has raised the target prices of all these cement makers. For UltraTech, the target has been raised to Rs 12,000 from Rs 9,300, for Dalmia Bharat, it is Rs 2,750 from Rs 2,360, for Ambuja Cement, it is Rs 600, up from Rs 390, for Grasim Industries, it is Rs 2,430 from Rs 1,977, for Shree Cement, it is Rs 28,500 from Rs 25,000 and, for ACC, the target price is now Rs 2,400, up from Rs 1,650.  While upgrading ACC and Ambuja Cement, Morgan cited a high starting point of utilisation rates that will limit volumes for both in the next couple of years. Despite this, with increased visibility on organic capacity expansion plans and a robust industry demand cycle expected to persist, Morgan believes the risk of volume market share losses for Ambuja Cement and ACC is now lower in the medium-to-long term. Additionally, synergy benefits from group companies are contributing to significant improvements in profitability, leading to the upgrade of both Ambuja Cement and ACC by a notch, it added.  Cement demand has been robust, showing low double-digit growth in recent years. Morgan Stanley sees the industry on a multi-year demand upcycle and predicts sustained growth at a faster pace than the GDP. It expects a 7&nbsp;percent CAGR in industry demand from 2024 to 2026, driven by infrastructure, with additional support from housing and industrial/ commercial segments.  The industry expanded capacity in recent years without disrupting demand-supply dynamics&nbsp;and utilisation rates have grown rapidly in the past three years. Despite a strong capacity addition pipeline, Morgan remains optimistic about industry utilisation rates staying strong and stable. Last year, the cement makers recorded significant margin expansion on the back of high demand and fuel cost deflation. As fuel costs normalise, Morgan expects sustained demand and increased utilisation to support the cement prices, leading to the next phase of margin expansion. They believe the risk of lower realisation is low in this cycle, thanks to industry consolidation and new capacity additions being concentrated among large players, minimising the risk of irrational pricing, it said.

The company&rsquo; sorganic capacity expansion plan is progressing well.

We have increased the volume growth guidance from earlier 10% CAGR to 12% CAGR over FY23- 25E. Major Benefit of lower fuel prices would start reflecting in between Q2-Q4FY24 as there is always a lag between order booked and order available for consumption. Further higher blending ratio , increase in the sale of premium products and consumption of higher green energy will aid to higher EBITDA margins going forward. We expect the company to report an EBITDA/ tonne of Rs 1180 &amp;amp;amp; Rs 1280 in FY24E/FY25E from Rs 1000/tonne in FY23 driven by higher volume, stable realization, and cost optimization initiatives.
