This same aggression could also have been the result of his downfall.,"Twenty-six years ago, IIM-Ahmedabad graduate Shantanu Prakash thought it was a good business opportunity to sell computers to schools. The idea was good and his brainchild Educomp Solutions was able to clock in Rs 1,000 crore revenue in 12 years and catered to 20,000 schools.  Cut to 2020, Prakash's company Educomp Solutions is bankrupt and on February 11, he was booked by Central Board of Investigation (CBI).  The CBI on February 11 registered a case against Educomp Solutions, Prakash and another individual for alleged bank fraud.  So how did the messiah of the ed-tech sector slide down a slippery slope? Industry insiders said that the early success of Prakash business was purely because of his entrepreneurial spirit and aggression. This same aggression could also have been the result of his downfall.  &amp;quot;Shantanu would manage to bring 50 schools on board even as we were struggling with one. We often noticed that these schools were not fully serious about the payments or contract continuity,&amp;quot; said the Vice- President of a rival firm.   Shantanu Prakash, founder of Educomp | Picture by Amit Verma, Forbes  Pioneering the concept of &lsquo;smart classrooms&rsquo;, Shantanu Prakash and his firm Educomp Solutions quickly progressed from selling computer to schools to selling technology for digitising educational content.  Educomp had the first mover advantage in the edtech sector and tasted quick success. The company was listed in 2006 and listed at Rs 125 per share. Over the next few years, word spread about Prakash&rsquo;s venture and several entities were set up trying to replicate his business model.  Within two decades, Educomp set up more than 25 offices across the globe and by 2012 revenue touched Rs 1,000 crore through the &lsquo;smartclass&rsquo; model. The stock also touched an all-time high of Rs 1,130 in January 2008.  Just five years after the IPO, Educomp had begun selling its products to almost 20,000 schools all across India. By now, Prakash was touted as the messiah of the education sector.  Prakash slowly started getting impatient. He was of the view that the company needed to grow bigger faster. A series of acquisitions followed. He entered segments like online test services and skilling.  However, competitors say, was that Prakash's unfettered ambitions got the better of him. Entering the K-12 schools segment, one which was dominated by legacy.  &ldquo;Shantanu definitely started to bite more than he could chew. If he only focussed on the core business, the company would have survived,&rdquo; said the chief financial officer of an education firm.  Simultaneously, the private schools started getting aggressive on pricing. Private schools have tremendous pricing power. Prakash&rsquo;s Educomp was able to book sales at any cost but was not able to deliver the products due to a pile-up of receivables.  Once the company started getting a bad name for delays, the debt troubles began from 2012. Former company employees said that Prakash underestimated the borrowings. From a high of Rs 1,076 crore in FY12, Educomp&rsquo;s revenue dropped to Rs 733 crore in FY13. From there it was a downward spiral.  The borrowings rose from a mere Rs 366 crore in FY08 to a whopping Rs 2,332 crore in FY17. In every transaction, Prakash was the face behind getting loans sanctioned.  &ldquo;He started borrowing one after another. On one hand, business consolidation was getting delayed and it was increasingly getting difficult to get investors. Shantanu was mistaken because he thought his brand name was enough to keep the coffers full,&rdquo; said a former senior management official of the company.  Moneycontrol tried to contact Prakash but was unable to reach him.  Around the same time senior officials of Educomp started to quit. Murmurs started about the company going bust. Prakash, being a first generation entrepreneur, did not give up.  In August 2012, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) was engaged to do a strategic review of Educomp. Post this, a decision was taken to exit the non-core business. Three core areas of digital content (SmartClass), K-12 school business and higher education segment were identified.  Prakash thought that hiving off businesses would help them the top position again. In 2013, Educomp made two exits in what it called non-core segments. The company sold its entire 50 percent stake in the vocational training firm IndiaCan, to its joint venture partner Pearson. It also sold 50 percent stake in Eurokids International Limited to a group of investors led by GPE India.  &amp;quot;Shantanu refused to look at the problem. It was clear that the bank debt would catch up sooner or later. This was due to the fact that the way he was doing business was flawed. Questions on how the books were accounted also remain,&amp;quot; said a former employee who worked with Prakash.  Cost cutting measures were being taken. Prakash thought that a leaner workforce would mean better efficiency. This led to a loss of almost 3,500 jobs in 2013-14.  The biggest problem with Educomp was that it was selling smart class on an outright basis and recognised revenue (75 per cent of contract value) over two years. This has resulted in a drop of revenue and profits. The expenses, on the other hand, were mostly fixed in nature (like salaries and administrative expenses) so EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortisation) and profit before tax dropped significantly.  While Prakash thought that the company would be able to recover once the payments process was streamlined, Educomp could be resurrected. However, by then banks had started knocking their doors seeking a repayment.  Prakash was in a fix. He announced in July 2013 that it Educomp has approached banks for corporate debt restructuring (CDR). By then the market had an inkling that a downfall was imminent. The stock price dropped drastically to Rs 23 by December 2013 and the market cap was eroded significantly. The stock hit a rock bottom of 99 paise intraday before closing at Rs 1.08 per share on February 12.  However, some signs of revival came in when Prakash was able to get an approval for the CDR scheme was already approved earlier comprising working capital debt of Rs 399.04 crore and long term debt of Rs 83.05 crore.  Prakash's charm was no longer working. Lenders started getting impatient even as he struggled to get delinquent schools back to track in 2015. The debt piled up to Rs 3,000 crore since Educomp was unable to pay loans. All funding requests were out-rightly rejected despite Prakash making personal requests.  A bigger shocker came when the statutory auditor (Haribhakti &amp;amp;amp; Co.) said that they were unable to make a 'fair' view of Educomp's financials due to some inconsistencies in the company&rsquo;s balance sheet.  This was the first time that Prakash&rsquo;s name was being dragged for alleged fraud. However, he consistently denied that wrongdoing. Once his name was tainted, there was no going back for either him or the company.  He, however, maintained that his 'business model' had failed and 'it did not work'.  Once the insolvency framework was finalised, Educomp went to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for insolvency in May 2017. However, various reports pointed that the company transferred its core business to other entities before filing for bankruptcy.  Even the bidders for Educomp, namely Boundary Holdings and Ebix Inc were found to have prior business relationships with Educomp.  Competitors were initially shocked about the alleged 'fudging' of accounts. Prakash was known to be &lsquo;out for business&rsquo; but not a fraudster. But with allegations piling up one after the other, it was clear that there were some issues with the company's books and that Prakash was aware of it.  In early 2019, Serious Fraud Investigation Office started probing Educomp for alleged fund diversion and inflated land deals. The chief executive of a large education-technology firm said that by then Prakash&rsquo;s credibility had deteriorated despite him pleading innocent on all occasions.  With the CBI now probing Prakash, Educomp for cheating a consortium of banks (led by State Bank of India) of Rs 1,955.36 crore, it looks like it is a done deal for the first education entrepreneur of the country.  CBI alleged that officials like Prakash used forged documents as genuine, diverted and siphoned off the banks&rsquo; funds and cheated the lending banks.  A revival is nowhere in sight. For Prakash, who borrowed Rs 1 lakh from his father to start Educomp Solutions, how he manages to get out of this sticky situation will be keenly watched.","Business, Companies, Educomp Solutions",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/a-look-atrisedownfalled-tech-messiah-shantanu-prakash_13489361.html

Sources told Moneycontrol that the inordinate delays in payments by the government agencies has led to companies withdrawing from these projects.  Both the&nbsp;Centre and the states follow a process of tenders for selecting agencies for implementation of their vocational education projects across various institutions. After the bidding process is completed, a successful bid is selected from the list of applicants.  &ldquo;Delays in payments are impacting the books. While the size of the projects are huge, we are giving it a miss because it profitability gets hit,&rdquo; said the chief executive of a large education sector company.  For large-scale tenders released, the government has primarily received interest from state-run and quasi-government agencies for project execution.  For the sector players, retail as well as corporate/institutional training account for almost 85 percent of the revenue of the companies. The rest goes into other businesses like publishing or educational infrastructure.  &amp;quot;One win in a government contract will be an instant revenue positive for companies. However, considering the track record of government payments, nobody is willing to risk it. We are however, completing the old projects that will be due in 2018 and 2019,&amp;quot; added the managing director of a large educational services firm.  About three years ago, vocational education was one of the largest revenue generation streams for education companies. However, as the defaults by government agencies started to get more frequent, companies started to slowly withdraw from these businesses.  Skill India  A large proportion of projects under vocational education are part of the Skill India Mission that aims to train 400 million people by 2020. Initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana are part of this initiative. Here, this scheme is being implemented by the National Skills Development Corporation (NSDC) under the guidance of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE). Owing to the its successful first year of implementation, the Union Cabinet has approved the scheme for another four years (2016-2020) to impart skilling to 10 million youth of the country.  Past instances  In other government-led programmes like implementing smart classrooms in schools, players like Educomp Solutions and Core Education had faced payment delays from the government. This had impacted both their top-line and bottom-line which consequently led to loans taken from banks to turn into non-performing assets.","Business, Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/education-sector-companies-say-no-to-governmentâs-vocational-training-business_11689361.html

Educomp Solutions (ESL), which was once a promising player in the private education space, defaulted on loans. With lenders staring at losses of over 87 percent of their total Rs 3,000 crore exposure, Educomp filed for bankruptcy, according to The Wire report.  Moneycontrol could not independently verify the authenticity of the report, and multiple calls to Shantanu Prakash, Promoter and Chairman of Educomp, elicited no response.  Educomp went to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for insolvency in May 2017. As per The Wire report, it has examined documented evidence that shows how ESL started the effective transfer of its core business to other companies having strong links with the original promoter before taking the original corporate entity to the bankruptcy court.  Boundary Holdings and Ebix Inc were the only two bidders for it at the NCLT and both were found to have business relationships with Educomp.  The report alleges that despite the statutory auditor&rsquo;s (Haribhakti &amp;amp;amp; Co. LLP) report on Educomp raising concerns over its balance sheet numbers, the NCLT auction proceedings appeared to be going on as if nothing is out of the ordinary.  The report also points out that when Educomp filed for insolvency, it effectively shifted its &lsquo;smart class business&rsquo; to another firm &ndash; Smart Class Educational Services Pvt Ltd (SESPL) and continued to do business with various schools.  It pointed out that contracts of a large number of schools that were &lsquo;smart class&rsquo; clients of Educomp were renewed under SEPSL either in part or full. Some of the schools were given incentives to sign contracts with SEPSL, according to a former employee of ESL who declined to be identified.  ESL listed its shares through IPO in 2006. Its share price went up to Rs 5,600 in 2008 and its market cap was around Rs 10,000 crore. It raised debt from banks by pledging its shares and assets. On March 30, 2018, its share price was around Rs 4.5 (after split) and market cap was about Rs 55 crore.  SBI, IDBI Bank, CBI, UBI, J&amp;amp;amp;K Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis bank, and PNB are among the lenders to ESL.","banking, Business, insolvency, NPAs",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/educomp-may-have-subvertedspiritinsolvencybankruptcy-code-report_10741281.html

Pioneers of the smart classroom concept in the country, these companies were on an aggressive expansion mode tying up with private sector schools as well as government schools. In the initial stages, while payments were steady, dues started mounting.  In the case of Everonn Education, a winding-up petition has been filed against the company by Hewlett-Packard Financial Services (India) in the Madras High Court. The court has appointed a provisional liquidator and has directed the said provisional liquidator to take possession of all the assets of the company.  Further, trading in the equity shares of Everonn Education has been suspended from November 4, 2016. There was a 97.4 percent drop in their share price ever since listing in 2007 to November 3.  In 1994, a few years after passing out of the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad (IIM-A), Shantanu Prakash set up Educomp Solutions with an aim to provide technology-enabled education solutions in the country. Within two decades, the company set up more than 25 offices across the globe and revenue touched Rs 129.39 crore for nine months ended December 2016.  Educomp's case is not an isolated one. P Kishore had co-founded Everonn Education (then called Systems International) in Tamil Nadu to take technology-based education back to grassroots. Almost 30 years later, Kishore is no longer associated with Everonn, which has seen its profits slump. Mumbai-headquartered Core Education and Technologies is no different which was founded about 15 years ago. With falling revenues and rising losses, Core is in talks with lenders to work out a restructuring package.  The conventional wisdom about education being a recession-proof sector has taken a few hard knocks. Unpaid dues, schools constantly pressurising them for discounts had led to weakening books of these companies.  Peers in the sector like Aptech and NIIT have widened the scope of their business beyond computer education. In order to stay relevant in the market, they have also embraced IT and skill training as well. They have kept costs under control and stayed focused on an asset-light model.  Debt servicing has also become an issue for some of these companies. Core Education, in its June results (which is the latest available), said that it is looking at various possibilities for financial revival of the company. These include paring down debt through bilateral negotiations with various lenders and accelerating collections of long-pending&nbsp;dues&nbsp;from some government clients. It is also negotiating with its lenders for restructuring and settlement of its loans. The company&rsquo;s stock has been suspended due to penal reasons.  Taking multiple ICT (Information and Communication Technology) contracts from government clients proved to be costly for these companies since mounting dues have only added to existing issues.  For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, Educomp posted a net loss of Rs 131 crore. In its results statement, the company said that they have incurred substantial losses and their net worth has been fully eroded.  &ldquo;The company has not been able to meet its debt-related obligations including those as per its CDR package executed with lenders,&rdquo; Educomp had said. The company did not respond to a questionnaire sent by Moneycontrol. As per its existing proposal, Educomp is planning to monetise its investments, receivables and assets apart from taking steps to improve its operational efficiencies.  On one hand, while debt restructuring packages may have to be significantly revised to offer payment flexibility to these companies so that they stay in business, branching out into other skilling areas where volumes could generate revenue growth is what could become the core focus in the future.","Aptech Limited, Business, Companies, Core Education & Technologies, Education & Training sector, Educomp Solutions, Everonn Education, Smart classroom",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/class-dismissed-education-tech-cosno-longer-recession-proof_8643401.html
