NCLAT's direction came over a petition filed by over 800 employees of Jyoti Structures.  Jyoti Structures was among the 12 companies in the first list issued by the government to face the insolvency proceedings in June 2017.  Lenders of the company could not finalise a buyer for the real estate firm under mandatory 270 days prescribed under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, failing which the company was heading for liquidation as mandated under the law.  DBS Bank, which is one of the lenders has opposed the resolution plan and had moved NCLT for liquidation of the company.","Business, Companies, India, Jyoti Structures, NCLAT",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/nclat-stays-jyoti-structures-liquidation_11327701.html

The Mumbai bench of the NCLT admitted an application against Jyoti Structures filed by its lead lender State Bank of India. The company owes lenders around Rs 7,000 crore.  The total amount due to SBI stands at about Rs 1,600 crore, after it was restructured in September 2014.  As per the NCLT order issued on Tuesday, the board of directors of the company will be suspended and consultancy firm, BDO would manage the company. The company has not opposed the action by the banks so far and has informed the court about a potential buyer interested in taking over the firm, according to reports.  BDO will take control of the company&rsquo;s management and be responsible for its day-to-day operations. It will work with the committee of creditors to come up with a resolution plan within 270 days, and get the approval of 75 percent of the creditors&rsquo; committee and supervised by the overseeing committee and then the nod from the NCLT. Failing this, the company will be liquidated according to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code rules.  In the financial year 2017, the company made a loss of Rs 1,482 crore on revenues of Rs 852 crore.  After failure to get a restructuring package from banks, it was set to be resolved through invocation of the Strategic Debt Restructuring Scheme (SDR) in terms of the extant RBI guidelines. Since then, the lenders decided to restructure the debt and evaluate investment proposal submitted by a strategic investor, outside SDR, the company had informed its shareholders last year.  Jyoti Structures is among the 12 companies that account for 25 percent of India&rsquo;s bad debt of about Rs 9.6 lakh crore.  Earlier this year, the government amended the Banking Regulation Act to empower the RBI to get directly involved in the resolution of non-performing assets (NPAs), Post this, RBI identified 12 large bad loan accounts having exposure of over Rs 5,000 crore each, with 60 percent or more classified as NPAs by banks as of March 2016, to be referred to the insolvency court.  RBI is further working on top 50 stressed accounts with an exposure of more than Rs 500 crore each.","bankruptcy, Business, insolvency, NPAs, Reserve Bank of India, SBI",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/jyoti-structures-first12-npas-to-face-bankruptcy-proceedings_9211601.html

Doing the numbers from all the rating agencies and brokerages it appears that total stressed loans whose borrowers have not been paying, cannot pay or will not pay interest on time is probably 15 percent of total assets, though banks as of September 2015 had declared only 5.1 percent of their assets as gross non performing assets (or default loans).But this once it appears the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is fully seized of the contours of the problem. Since mid 2014, the RBI has put in a new software called CRILC or (Central Respository of Information for Large Credits). Banks report details of all their accounts to this repository, where the accounts are identified by their PAN numbers. The RBI thus has a master list of borrowings of all the big borrowers and it has been sharing these with banks. Penalties have been imposed on banks who fall short on reporting accounts that are falling back on repayments. In its annual inspection of bank books this time, the RBI was empowered to use a different route. Instead of a bank-wise inspection of asset quality it called for account wise inspection across the banking system. It stands to reason that the central bank now knows the numbers better than anyone and it has shared these numbers regularly with bankers.It is on the strength of this information that the regulator has now told banks to mark as non performing Assets (NPAs) all accounts that show stress: accounts which have defaulted with one bank but not another, promoters who have not brought their share of equity in restructured cases, or who have brought their share of the equity by borrowing from other entities, in short any account where the flow of monies from the asset is inadequate to service the loan.These strict rules from the regulator come at a time when bank shares world over are being pulverized because of the steep decline in commodities and the inevitable expectation that banks will see more corporate defaults. The selling in Indian bank shares has therefore become even more frenzied, accompanied as it is by more and more apocalyptic reports from brokerages.However, my detailed discussion with public sector bankers and RBI officials gives me a feeling that the situation while grim is controllable. Senior public sector bankers told me that if they have to provide for all their stress assets by March 2017, they have the means. Private banks, if anything are even better capitalized. The quiet confidence of senior RBI officials is also reassuring. They maintain that the government has been taken on board in this clean-up exercise and they have been assured that whatever is needed by way of capital will be provided. If that is the case, then this near term pain that all banks are going through is worth enduring. It is not apocalyptic. This too shall pass.There is an argument one often hears from bankers, India Inc and even columnists: that this is the wrong time to order a clean up since growth worldwide is at its worst. This was same the dangerous argument that backed the RBI's 2009 regulation allowing banks to do a one-time-restructuring of bad accounts. The argument was that this is a &amp;quot;passing phase&amp;quot;. As it turned out, banks and corporates were in better shape in 2009, and ought not have restructured stressed assets. They should have called the stressed assets NPAs and arranged for provisions. This would at least have prevented them from throwing good money after bad. Who knows, in 2018, this may still be the good old days. So let banks provide for all suspected bad accounts and then move on to lend to newer, healthier companies.While bankers must bear the pain of their past mistakes, there is one side of the transaction which hasn&amp;amp;rsquo;t really borne the pain, the promoter. Even today companies that are being taken over by banks through conversion of loans to equity under strategic debt restructuring are relatively small fry like Jyoti Structures or Electrosteel. What about the Essars and Lancos and GMRs. Essar Steel is a case in point. The company defaulted on its foreign bond holders in 1999, defaulted on its bankers in 2003 when its loan was restructured and was on the verge of default again this year when bankers once again gave it a lifeline through a 5-25 loan refinance.Aren't three defaults enough to require a change in management? Then why have bankrs refinanced Essar Steel&amp;amp;rsquo;s loan under the 5-25 scheme and not a strategic debt restructure that will remove the owners? In the first place, how can a 20 year old plant be given loan for a further 20 or 25 years. Also, in the past five years the promoters, the Ruias have made decent money first by selling their stake in Vodafone at solid 5 billion dollars. They are recently in the money again thanks to the sale of Essar Oil to Roseneft. Why aren&amp;amp;rsquo;t promoters bearing a larger share of Essar Steel&amp;amp;rsquo;s problems, but leaving it to the banks to bring more funds.?While the move to clean up banks' balancesheets is welcome, it&amp;amp;nbsp;needs to be accompanied by a move to make some of the promoters pay as well.","Business, Electrosteel Steels, Essar Oil, GMR Infrastructure, Jyoti Structures, RBI",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/its-not-quite-apocalypse-for-banks_5050661.html
