Reported USD revenue grew 5.7% QoQ, driven by broad-based growth across verticals, with RCM (+2.9% QoQ in CC) back in growth track. Deal TCV in 2QFY23 was strong at USD518m, up 44% YoY, and aided the company surpass USD1b TCV in 1HFY23. EBITDA margin contracted 10bp QoQ (50bp ahead of MOFSLe) to 21.0%, despite the full impact of wage hikes during the quarter. The company was able to compensate for this through operational efficiency, currency support and reversal of a one-off cost last quarter. Utilization (down 50bp QoQ) and attrition (decline of 40bp QoQ to 24.1%) were broadly stable. MTCL's management indicated that it has started to witness some softness and caution in parts of the business (especially in Europe), although these appear to be transitory in its opinion. Management remained confident that MTCL will be able to take advantage of the acquired projects that are cost-saving in nature, thereby boosting both performance and TCV. Strong commentary in other verticals, deal pipeline, and TCV should help it deliver a solid revenue growth in FY23E, as we expect USD revenue CAGR of 16.5% over FY22-24. MTCL should keep its profitability within a narrow range going ahead, which will help it absorb any adverse macro impact. Good revenue growth and stable margin should help it deliver 23% PAT CAGR in INR terms over FY22-24E.  Outlook We maintain our Neutral rating on MTCL due to its fair valuations (based on 22x FY24E P/E), softness in Retail and constrains on management bandwidth because of its impending merger with LTI. We raise our FY23/FY24 EPS estimates by 3%/6% due to strong growth and margin beat. As the stock is trading at 22x FY24E EPS, we see limited upside hereafter.

Reported operating margin remained flattish by -3bps to 19.1% QoQ due to wage hike impact of 240 bps which was partially offset by the absence of 60 bps one-off merger expense, 50 bps net tailwind from Rupee depreciation/cross-currency movements, 70 bps from operational efficiencies and remaining from lower travel and other expenses. Reported Net profit was up by ~8% QoQ to INR 5,087mn with margin of 15.0%, down 14bps on QoQ basis. The growth in the quarter for Mindtree was broad based and across geographies/services. Deal TCV was at USD 518mn, up 44% YoY, and seems to have benefited from the rise in longer tenure cost optimization deals.

Deal TCV was at USD 390mn, up 4% YoY, comprising a healthy mix of annuity and transformational deals. Mindtree&rsquo;s improvement in both growth/margin and correlation between TCV/growth on short cycle deals is led by (1) building full-stack account and account mining focus (top-100 driving 90% of revenue as well as reduced T1 concentration risk) and (2) focus on building partner ecosystem and hyperscalers proposition (MTCL has strong rating within leading cloud providers).

Outlook MTCL is currently trading at a valuation with a P/E multiple of 32.7x/26.6x on FY23E/FY24E earnings.

It sees scope for continued performance in their 4x4x4 strategy and investments required to boost long-term growth. Here are the key highlights from the meet: The demand outlook for the industry continues to remain strong. It has not seen any slowdown due to the recent inflationary concerns. This, aided by the ongoing shift of spends to Cloud-based migration from legacy, will help reallocate its technology expenses. While there is still pressure on the supply-side due to lower fresher additions over the last few years, MTCL is not worried as demand is sufficient to absorb the cost pressures. The management reiterated its plan to maintain EBITDA margin ~20% and reinvest any savings in accelerating business growth. The company introduced its six strategic levers for FY23, which they expect to boost their positioning. These are: a) full stack account, b) reimagine the ecosystem, c) shift from run IT to product IT ops, d) edge to experience for Industry X.0, e) enable industry convergence, and f) next-gen delivery capabilities for integrated solutions. It also reiterated its 4x4x4 strategy (four industry groups, four service lines, and four geographies). It continues to see opportunities across industries and services. Including the evolving Healthcare vertical as the fifth industry unit, MTCL is seeing an increased trend of clients operating across industry lines and sees convergence as a key theme going forward.

Reported operating margin expanded by 107bps to 19.2% QoQ aided by operational efficiencies (+60bps QoQ), and FX tailwind (+40bps) and seem sustainable at this level supported by sustained revenue growth momentum, benefits accruing from the WFH shift, flattening employee pyramid and the offshore shift.
