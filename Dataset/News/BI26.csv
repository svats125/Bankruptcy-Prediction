","Indus Towers on Monday posted a 38 percent rise in consolidated net profit to about Rs 1,559 crore for September 2021 quarter, as reforms announced recently for the telecom industry led to a sharp improvement in business sentiments.  The net profit of the telecom infrastructure firm was about Rs 1,131 crore in the year-ago period, according to a company statement.  The consolidated revenues of Indus Towers (formerly Bharti Infratel) during the just-ended September quarter stood at Rs 6,877 crore, up about 8 percent year-on-year.  Indus Towers, Managing Director and CEO, Bimal Dayal noted that this was a significant quarter for the telecom industry in the backdrop of the announcement of major reforms, which resulted in a sharp improvement in business sentiments.  &amp;quot;We welcome this vital step and are prepared to partner with our stakeholders in the journey towards Digital India,&amp;quot; Dayal said in the statement.  The company continued to improve its operational performance with an increase in net colocations during the quarter and delivered a strong financial performance, Dayal observed.  The consolidated EBITDA, which came in at about Rs 3,641 crore in Q2 FY22, was 17 percent higher than the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

Hence, the company has given proforma unaudited consolidated results,&amp;quot; the company statement explained.  The telecom sector has got a shot in the arm, with the government recently approving a blockbuster relief package that includes a four-year break for companies from paying statutory dues, permission to share scarce airwaves, change in the definition of revenue on which levies are paid and 100 percent foreign investment through the automatic route.  The measures, aimed at providing relief to companies such as Vodafone Idea that have to pay thousands of crores in unprovisioned past statutory dues, also include the scrapping of Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC) for airwaves acquired in future spectrum auctions.  Telecom operators like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have already said they will opt for the four-year moratorium on payment of dues.  The moratorium is likely to free up cash flow to the tune of thousands of crores for telcos.","Business, Indus Towers, Results",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/indus-towers-q2-net-profit38-at-rs-1559-crore-revenue-rises-to-rs-6877-crore_15669161.html

Indus&rsquo; Q3FY21 was operationally healthy lead by strong tower additions, tenancy growth and rental/tenant led by exit penalties. Energy spread was negative for 3rd consecutive quarter. Indus&rsquo; short-term prognosis remains positive led by potential tariff increase in the telecom sector and/or fund-raise by VIL. Stake sale (even partial) by Vodafone Plc (~28%) could lead to supply overhang. The medium-term risk for BHIN are wrt survivability of VIL and/or reduction in rental/tenant. Shutdown of VIL may significantly impact the business of Indus. Indus it may lead to ~40-45% reduction in tenancies in our view and a severe impact on profitability. VIL&rsquo;s struggle with fund-raise and lack of tariff hikes increases this risk. Reduction in rentals/tenant on renewals as tenancies come out of lock-in in FY23 (similar to energy spread correction) is another key risk. We have factored a 5% reduction in rental/tenant in our TP. Outlook On merger of Infratel-Indus and as part of security package arrangement with Vodafone Plc, Indus declared a dividend of Rs 48bn (Rs 17.8/sh ~7.7% yield).
