On the weekly charts, the Nifty has been consistently hitting record highs over the past three weeks and maintaining levels near the top, indicating strong confidence among market participants.  In the shorter term, particularly on the daily timeframe, the index has been exhibiting a positive structure with higher highs and higher lows, while finding solid support at the 34-day EMA (exponential moving average) for the past three months.  Key technical indicators such as the relative strength index (RSI) are also favourable, with readings above 65 across daily, weekly, and monthly intervals, signaling positive momentum.  Looking forward, immediate resistance levels are noted at 22,780, representing Fibonacci Extension levels, with further resistance at 23,000. Crucial support levels are identified at 22,000 and 21,800.  Given the current chart patterns, a strong bullish phase is anticipated. It is recommended to consider buying at the current market price, with potential upside targets ranging from 22,780 to 23,000 levels. To effectively manage risks, it is advised to implement a strict stop-loss at 22,000 on a closing basis.  Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 583.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 533 | Target: Rs 696 | Return: 19 percent  ICICI Prudential Life has demonstrated remarkable resilience, notably since hitting its 52-week low in March 2023. The stock has been consistently advancing within a bullish trajectory. In a recent noteworthy development, the stock has broken out of a Flag and Pole chart pattern, coinciding with a downward sloping channel originating from its September 2021 all-time high. This breakout was accompanied by a significant surge in trading volume, surpassing the 21-week average volume, indicating positive momentum.  Additionally, ICICI Prudential Life has maintained its position above both the 12-week and 26-week exponential moving averages (EMA), further consolidating the bullish trend.  Momentum indicators such as the RSI and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) support this bullish sentiment. The MACD has signaled a positive crossover, while the RSI stands at a robust 60, indicating the strength of the trend by substantial momentum.  Looking forward, there is an anticipation of further price ascent towards Rs 696 mark. It is recommended to set a stop-loss at Rs 533, strictly based on the closing basis.    Shriram Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 2449.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,249 | Target: Rs 2,885 | Return: 18 percent  Since March 2022, Shriram Finance has demonstrated a robust price structure, characterized by a consistent upward trend. Notably, in June 2023, the stock broke out of a volatility contraction pattern (VCP), leading to the formation of higher highs and higher lows. This trend signifies a bullish momentum.  Moreover, Shriram Finance has shown a strong adherence to the 12-week and 26-week moving averages, indicating the strength of the prevailing trend. The momentum of Shriram Finance is further supported by the RSI, which has consistently remained above 60 across various timeframes. This suggests sustained strength in the upward trajectory of the stock.  Furthermore, when comparing Shriram Finance to the Nifty through a ratio chart, there's a continuous upward trend, indicating persistent outperformance compared to the broader market.  Going ahead, we expect the prices to go higher till the level of Rs 2,885, the bullish view will be negated if we see prices sustaining below Rs 2,249 level.    Tata Consumer Products: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,261.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,163 | Target: Rs 1,518 | Return: 20 percent  Tata Consumer Products demonstrates a robust price structure, with a clear uptrend observable since October 2001, characterized by higher highs and higher lows over the long term. Presently, the stock is maintaining its position above the congestion zone and is trading at its all-time high, indicating significant strength in the current uptrend.  The trend support is further strengthened by the stock's ability to remain above both the 12-week and 26-week moving averages. Additionally, a bullish crossover on the MACD indicator occurring in positive territory adds momentum to the ongoing upward trend, affirming the bullish sentiment surrounding Tata Consumer Products.  Moreover, when analyzing Tata Consumer Products against the Nifty using a ratio chart, a continuous upward trend is evident, suggesting sustained outperformance compared to the broader market.  Looking forward, there is an anticipation of further price ascent towards Rs 1,518 mark. It is recommended to set a stop-loss at Rs 1,163, strictly based on the closing basis.

APE is seen at Rs 1,856 crore, as per a poll of brokerages.  APE is essentially a measure of sales for a life insurer. The muted growth is largely in line with the industry trend as premium growth has been dull for the entire life insurance industry, as per IRDAI data.  Further, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance's VNB (value of new business) margins are set to contract over 400 basis points&nbsp;YoY to 29.3 percent due to a change in product mix.    Analysts at Emkay Research pointed out that sales of non-par products were higher in the base quarter while ULIP sales, which fetch lower margins, were higher in the quarter gone by.  ULIP stands for unit-linked insurance products.&nbsp;ULIPs are market-linked products, a combination of insurance plus investment. With markets touching new highs, ULIP sales were higher last year.  Meanwhile, non-par products are those in which profits are not shared with policyholders, and thus, the margins are higher.

As net profit is not a key metric for life insurance companies, several brokerages have not&nbsp;shared&nbsp;estimates for the bottomline number, except Motilal Oswal Financial Services. The domestic broking firm expects PAT to grow 25.7 percent YoY to Rs 280 crore.

Surrender penalty caps would limit surrender charges after a policyholder voluntarily terminates an insurance policy before its maturity or occurrence of an insured event. In this manner, a policyholder would receive a higher payout for the insurance they paid and surrender charges would be reduced. This, analysts believe could take a toll on insurance companies' margins.  On January 16, at 11:45 am, the stock was trading flat on the NSE at Rs&nbsp;523.

However, in the backdrop of taxation changes related to high-ticket, non-linked policies, this strong show in Q4 does not allay concerns over the growth and profitability outlook in FY24 and beyond. Looking ahead, on one hand, taxation changes will affect the high-ticket, non-linked product growth and, on the other, regulatory changes in commissions, EoM and banca partnership limits might drive the intensified competition in banca and partnership channels. Overall, the outlook on growth and profitability is much sober than the solid recent past; however, the undemanding valuation (FY24E P/EV of 1.6x) appears to be pricing in the challenges ahead. As IPRU and other peers navigate through the changing regulatory and taxation landscape, shares will likely move laterally.

Absolute VNB reported growth of 23.2% YoY for 9MFY23 at Rs17.1bn, driven by strong VNB margin (+4.9ppts YoY) and moderate APE growth (+4% YoY), beating our estimate by 5%. The sharp increase in margin is owing to increase in Non-Par saving, Annuity and Protection products in the product mix. Retail protection appears to be finally turning the corner, with Q3FY23 Retail protection APE rising sequentially and also exceeding Q4FY22 levels. On the distribution front, all channels, except ICICI Bank, are clocking satisfactory-to-strong performance. ICICI Bank&rsquo;s share in the APE mix has gone down to ~18% in 9MFY23, but decline in the channel APE persists. Net net, developments in VNB margin, retail protection, non-ICICI Bank channel distribution and persistency afford increased confidence to the company, and the FY24 APE growth outlook holds the key for IPRU shares. Management appears positive about FY24 growth prospects, on grounds of the robust growth performance in agency and ex-ICICI Bank banca partnerships as well as the declining impact of ICICI Bank channel de-growth.  Outlook Accounting for the developments in 9MFY23, we marginally tweak our FY23-25 estimates and reiterate our BUY rating, with our Dec-23E Target Price remaining unchanged at Rs605/share, implying FY24E P/EV of 2.1x. Post their underperformance over the past few years, IPRU shares are now valued at FY24E P/EV of 1.7x &ndash; still meaningfully undervalued versus peers and own history, and likely reflecting the negativity of the poor top-line growth and the muted expectation being already in the price. With the valuation relatively undemanding, we expect IPRU shares to re-rate, once top-line growth returns.
