Lenders of Lanco Resources International Pte Limited (LRIPL), a Lanco Infratech subsidiary, which owns Griffin Coal Mine, have earlier appointed PWC as receiver and manager to look for an investor as the Aussie company defaulted payment.  &amp;quot;Griffin Coal is no longer our subsidiary.

The total loss incurred by the group on account of Griffin Coal would be USD 300 million,&amp;quot; T Adi Babu, chief operating officer-finance, Lanco Infratech told PTI.  Lanco Infratech, through its Australian subsidiary, acquired Griffin Coal Mining Company and Carpenter Mine Management for AUD 740 million in March 2011.  Though the transfer of shares was to have legal title on the shares to the lenders, the beneficial interest continued to be with with the company, as part of &amp;quot;perfection&amp;quot; of security under the Singapore laws, Lanco had earlier said.  The sale process of Griffin Coal in 2011 was overseen by Kodramentha- administrator of Carpenter Mine. The Australian mine is continuously making cash losses ever since its acquisition.  Production at the mine during the FY17 was 2.50 million tonnes with sales of 2.45 MT. Production was less than optimal as the fall in international coal prices did not economically justify exporting a part of the production.  In 2015, Lanco alleged that Kordanentha misled the bidders by withholding two reports suggesting the Griffin coal deposits were smaller than disclosed first. Denying Lanco's allegation, Kordamentha in turn made a counter allegation that Lanco defaulted its instalment to the tune of USD 150 for the mine.  Adi Babu said the issue has been settled out of court as the Australian advisory and investment firm agreed to pay about USD 10 million as expenses and also waive USD 150 million payment instalment by Lanco.  &amp;quot;The case was settled. We were to pay USD 150 million. (as part of the settlement). We dont have to pay that amount. It was waived. The advantage of the settlement will also go to the bank (lenders).

Only last week, New Delhi-based Hindustan Powerprojects' had encashed bank guarantees of Lanco Infratech worth Rs 500 crore after it had alleged incomplete contractual obligations at the latter&rsquo;s 2,520 MW Anuppur thermal power plant.  However, this time around, suppliers or sub-contractors of the debt-laden engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm have alleged that Lanco is trying to cheat and collect money from the market by encashing bank guarantees of various sub-contractors citing non-fulfillment of a work contract.  &ldquo;We were given a purchase order by Lanco Infratech against which there were bank guarantees. Our work had started but there was delay apprehension after their financial position was in trouble.&nbsp;We asked for a second advance which they were continuously delaying and the project was on hold because of their financial constraints. They promised in May that they would repay the second advance by June 20 and we started the work again. But on June 23, they invoked our bank guarantee.&nbsp;We have not violated any contract. However, we got a notice that our bank guarantee is invoked and so are of other sub-contractors,&rdquo; said a spokesperson of Kelvion India, one of the sub-contractors.  Suppliers give bank guarantees to a buyer against an advance paid to carry out a project.  The Kelvion spokesperson added that this is highly unethical as the projects are stuck because of their own financial issues. Large amounts were given as advances to these sub-suppliers, but progress had been lacking for the past 10 months.  Apart from Kelvion India, other sub-contractors such as Pentair Valves and Controls, Vaas Automation, Emerson Process Management India and others had also received notification that their bank guarantees have been encashed by Lanco.  The total amount of bank guarantees encashed from five of the suppliers is about Rs 3.43 crore.  The amounts and dates of these bank guarantees ordered vary, but the date of the invocation letters sent by Lanco to the banks (copies seen by Moneycontrol)&nbsp;is the same &mdash; June, 23.  In its letters to banks, Lanco has said that the companies have &ldquo;not completed their contractual obligations&rdquo; and have &ldquo;failed to execute the said PO (purchase order)&rdquo;.  The sub-contracting companies plan to go to the court to fight the battle against Lanco for &ldquo;illegally and unethically encashing the bank guarantees&rdquo;.  Lanco Infratech could not be reached for comment. An email sent to the company remained unanswered.  Just about a fortnight before, the lead consortium lender IDBI Bank decided to initiate corporate insolvency proceedings against the company at the&nbsp;the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), under&nbsp;the Insolvency and Bankruptcy&nbsp;Code.  Lanco had earlier approached the Delhi High Court for an injunction against Hindustan Power from encashing its bank guarantee, which the court had rejected on July 1. A majority of the banks have followed the directive of the court and revoked the bank guarantees. However, some banks are yet to take a call.  Hindustan Power has multiple claims against Lanco, including large cash advances and unfinished work at the thermal site, according to reports.  Last month, Lanco informed the stock exchanges that the RBI has directed IDBI Bank, the lead bank of Lanco Infratech to initiate Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against defaulting of fund based outstanding loan exposure worth Rs 8,146 crore for and Rs 3,221 crore for non-fund based exposure as on March 31, 2016.  Lanco group&rsquo;s total debt exceeds Rs 44,365 crore and is a non-performing asset (NPA) for most banks.  In 2015, Lanco revealed plans to seal its power assets, with an enterprise value of about Rs 25,000 crore, in 2018, hoping to bring down the debt by Rs 18,000 crore. However, it could only sell 1,200 MW imported coal-based thermal power project in the Udupi district of Karnataka to Adani Power for an enterprise value of Rs 6,300 crore in the same year.  The NCLT is likely to take up the case by this month to arrive at a resolution in 6-9 months or take the company for liquidation.","bankruptcy, Business, Companies, NCLT, NPAs, RBI",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/lanco-infra39s-contractors-may-move-court-against-encashmentbank-guarantees_9242941.html

A workable solution has to be found to deal with the NPAs in the sector.,"Jitendra Gupta Moneycontrol Research  A sizeable chunk of bank loans are to the power sector where many projects have little or no economic value. Private sectors players like Tata Power, Adani Power, GMR and others want to exit some of these projects, but are not finding takers. The few buyers who have expressed interest are demanding a hefty discount. Recently, SREI bid for one of GMR&rsquo;s gas based 768 MW&nbsp;power plant in Rajahmundry, where the terms indicated that the banks will have to take a 50 percent haircut on the outstanding debt.  Nevertheless, government and banks are looking for innovative ways to deal with the issue. According to a section of the media, banks have identified nine such stressed projects which could be managed by NTPC without any financial liability or commitment.  It is expected that some of these projects might get bundled into a separate entity managed by NTPC. Most of these projects will require huge equity infusion to make them viable. One workable solution would be for the banks to convert some of their debt to equity and bring in additional equity probably from the government (through NTPC) or other investors.  Many of these troubled assets have huge execution issues; but NTPC&rsquo;s existing operations will not be impacted unless the entire burden of ownership falls on NTPC. However, owning these assets will inflate its own debt to equity and deteriorate its credit rating and exert pressure on financials, which will have an impact on the lenders as well.  In all probability, these assets will remain in the books of the banks. Any equity investor would be interested if these assets offer a decent return in the region of about 14-18 percent.  Hypothetically, to construct a new 10,000 MW of (coal-based) power capacity today would cost around Rs 80,000 crore. With the debt to equity of 70:30, it will require close to Rs 24,000 crore of equity. Now, if 10,000 MW of stressed power assets are bundled, since there is no equity left, the project cost will increase to Rs 104,000 crore. (Rs 80,000 crore being original cost and Rs 24,000 crore of new infusion by the banks). At that cost, there will be hardly any return on equity because the competitive tariffs (based on 14-16 return on equity) will be largely set at the project cost of Rs 80,000 crore. This effectively means if equity investors have to come in these projects, the banks will have to take a hit, which may vary depending on the cost overrun during the period of construction and capitalisation of losses during the period of operation.  The only silver lining is that the related debt in the books of the companies that are holding these assets and incurring expenses such as interest cost, will come down significantly as the debt will be knocked off from the balance sheet of these companies.  But it is too simplistic to remotely suggest that the assets taken over by the banks can be turned around. Most of these companies are or about to go for the insolvency proceedings as their business viability has completely eroded.  For instance, in the case of Lanco Infra the banks have been directed by the RBI to initiate corporate insolvency process. In this case, since there is no equity and the assets aren&rsquo;t enough to pay back the debt, there will be very little left for the equity investors. To put the numbers in perspective, Lanco has got close to Rs 50,000 crore debt on its books as against the net fixed asset value of about Rs 20,000 crore, indicating that there is a huge gap to be covered and the possibly of deep haircut that the banks will take as the asset goes for resolution.","Business, Companies, Economy",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/after-steel-next-uppower-sector39s-npas-innovative-solutions-need-to-be-found_9211261.html

It has not been servicing the loan since December 2016. ","Led by ICICI Bank, lenders to Lanco Resources International (LRIPL), the overseas arm the debt-laden Lanco Infratech, which owns the Griffin Coal Mine in Australia, have appointed PwC as the receiver and entrusted it with the task of finding an investor, following loan default.  The loss-making mining company owes Rs 6,250 crore plus accumulated interest and penalties to the lenders. It has not been servicing the loan since December 2016.  The Lanco Group which has been in financial doldrums for quite a few years, is also a defaulter with a consolidated net of over Rs 40,000 crores. ICICI Bank Singapore is the leader of the lenders' consortium which also has other domestic and overseas lenders, according to a senior Lanco official.  The official, who requested not to be quoted, told PTI here that the lenders will have 18 months to bring in a new investor and hand over the management of the mine which means PwC will have to find a buyer investor within that time frame.  The official also said the accumulated loss of Griffin Coal now stands at over Rs 2,000 crore eroding its net worth. Receivership is a type of corporate action in which a receiver is appointed by courts or creditors to run the financially stressed company.  In most cases, the receiver is given ultimate decision-making powers and has full discretion in deciding how the assets under his control will be managed. &amp;quot;ICICI Bank Singapore and other lenders have appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory Services as the Receivers and Managers of the company...and to find an investor/buyer.  PwC as the reciever would also have to ensure that pledged shares are transferred to the new receiver administration for the purpose of security,&amp;quot; the official said. Though the shares are transferred on the lenders&rsquo;s name, Lanco will continue to be beneficial owner, the official added. &ldquo;The lenders now have 18 months to change the management (from Lanco) wherein majority stake has to be given to somebody.  The banks will now start looking for an investor who can put in money into the mine and bring value to the company and shares,&amp;quot; the official explained adding, &amp;quot;Lanco is expected to remain a minority shareholder in the Australian company if the new investor acquires over 50 per cent stake.&amp;quot;  The struggling parent Lanco Infratech through its Australian subsidiary, acquired the loss-making Griffin Coal Mining Company and Carpenter Mine Management for AUD 740 million in March 2011 when commodity prices were at the peak.  The sale process was overseen by Kodramentha- the administrator of Carpenter Mine. But even after the management buyout the mines are making cash losses from the year of acquisition in 2011 and the accumulated losses have jumped to Rs 2,000 crore as of march 2016. One of the reasons for this is also the crash in coal prices since early 2014. All the efforts put in by the Lanco to bring an investor failed due to subdued coal prices.  In 2015, Lanco had alleged that Kordanentha misled the bidders by withholding two reports suggesting the Griffin coal deposits were much lower than disclosed first. Denying Lanco&rsquo;s allegation, Kordamentha, in turn, made a counter allegation that Lanco defaulted its installment to the tune of AUD 150 for the mine. Both the parties are slugging it out in Australian courts now.  When contacted, T Adi Babu, Chief Operating Officer- Finance, Lanco Infratech said the company is currently not in a position to invest large amounts in the mine expansion. &amp;quot;The mine (in Australia) cannot to be expanded (in order to create value) as most of the approvals have come for port and the mines. Somebody has to pump in money. We do not have the wherewithal to do that now,&amp;quot; Adi Babu told","Business, Lanco Resources International, NPA",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/lenders-appoint-pwc-to-find-investors-for-lanco39s-oz-coal-mine_8877701.html
