A CNBC Awaaz report said the USFDA classified the unit as&nbsp;No Action Indicated (NAI), paving the way for manufacturing and export from the plant.

Companies also reported minimal impact from the Red Sea crisis.  Growth in the Indian pharmaceuticals market surpassed estimates for many, driven by higher volumes from an expanded field force. Analysts at YES Securities highlighted margin improvement facilitated by softening input costs and reduced freight expenses.  Analysts at Nuvama&nbsp;observed a benign generic price erosion in the US, attributed to ongoing shortages and&nbsp;longer approval timelines. This trend benefited generic companies, as seen in their improved gross margin performance. They also noted that as abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) approvals outpaced ANDA submissions in 2023, R&amp;amp;amp;D investments in non-complex products slowed substantially, supporting a better price environment for Indian generic pharma manufacturers.  Sun Pharmaceutical&nbsp;Industries Ltd.&nbsp;reported revenue growth supported by the specialty business, new US generic launches and steady growth in India. Global specialty sales accounted for 19.2 percent of Q3FY24 sales, and doubled its contribution from 7 percent in FY18 to over 16 percent in FY23. HDFC Securities analysts anticipate this growth momentum to persist in the coming quarters.  Dr Reddy's&nbsp;&nbsp;Laboratories&nbsp;exhibited strong sequential performance over the past four quarters, driven by the generic version of US pharmaceutical company Celgene's cancer drug Revlimid, with expectations of continuity for the next four to five&nbsp; quarters, according to HDFC Securities analysts.  Cipla introduced the&nbsp;off-patent variant of AstraZeneca's&nbsp;inhaler Symbicort and one peptide product in the quarter, with plans for four more peptides in FY25. Despite witnessing an on-year revenue increase of 13.66 percent and a profit rise of 31.83 percent, there was a marginal decline in revenue (1.11 percent) and profit (6.63 percent) compared to the previous quarter.  Lupin's US business recorded a revenue of $212 million in the three months to December 2023, representing a 0.5 percent increase on a quarterly basis. New launches such as antiretroviral therapy drug darunavir and respiratory product gSpiriva continue to gain traction, with the company achieving market shares of up to 30 percent and 32 percent, respectively, despite experiencing low single-digit price erosion in its base business. Recent approvals of 180 days' exclusivity for tolvaptan (used for treating low sodium in the blood, among other things, and which has a market size of $287 million) and the US' FMC Corporation's fungicide Xyway (market size $958 million) could add business in the second half.  Aurobindo Pharma reported a 90.6 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 936.2 crore for the October-December quarter. Its margins were supported by steady US growth, normalisation in input cost, improved gross margin and overall cost controls, according to analysts from HDFC Securities.  Mankind Pharma&rsquo;s consolidated net profit increased 55 percent to Rs 460 crore in the third quarter. Nirmal Bang analysts predict future growth strategy for the company to revolve around an increased presence in the chronic diseases segment, improved scale in consumer healthcare, deeper penetration in metro and Class I cities and increasing doctor engagements, especially with specialists.","Business, pharma",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/strong-india-growth-benign-price-erosionthe-us-drive-q3-earnings-for-indian-pharma_17483301.html

Manufacturers failing to comply with the price cap have to return the overcharged amount to the government.  Various medications for type 2 diabetes, blood pressure, antibiotics, cough syrups and depression medication will be under price control.  Combination of dapagliflozin, metformin hydrochloride (extended release) and glimepiride tablets for type 2 diabetes will be priced around Rs 14 each, while the sitagliptin phosphate, metformin hydrochloride and glimepiride combination drug&nbsp;will be priced at Rs 13 per tablet.  Various drugs manufactured by listed players like Sun Pharmaceuticals, Alkem Laboratories, Cipla Ltd, Mankind Pharma, Lupin Ltd and Torrent Pharma are included in the list.

Prices of HIV medication Zidovudine, Desferrioxamine used in thalassemia and budesonide-formoterol combination used in asthma have also been brought under price control.  Set up in 1997, the drug pricing regulator is vested with the responsibility of fixing and revising prices of pharmaceutical products, enforcing provisions of the Drug Price Control Order (DPCO), and monitoring the prices of both controlled and decontrolled drugs. The primary objective of the NPPA is to ensure the availability of essential medicines at reasonable and regulated prices. The authority has mandated every retailer and dealer to prominently display prices at their business premises, ensuring easy accessibility for consumers.  Recent reports indicate that the Federation of Pharma Entrepreneurs (FOPE), a prominent lobby group, has urged the regulator to temporarily halt a notice. The notice had cautioned drug manufacturers of potential penal actions if new drugs were introduced before their retail prices were officially notified.","Business, NPPA, price control",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/diabetes-bp-drugs-to-cost-less-as-nppaÂ fixes-retail-prices69-formulations_17481691.html

The government is planning tighter regulations on their quality, pricing and marketing aspects","Nutraceuticals, encompassing vitamins, minerals, omega-3 products, fibre and herbal supplements, have gained popularity for their touted benefits like better health, anti-aging effects, disease prevention, and overall well-being.  COVID-19 fuelled the rise in dietary supplement usage, particularly for boosting immunity. Currently, the global nutraceutical market is dominated by the US, Japan, and Europe.  What are the recent developments in India?  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is planning to bring these products under the supervision of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). Nutraceuticals are currently governed by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). But it only regulates the quality of these products, leaving their usage and marketing uncontrolled. The proposed move aims to enhance quality control, with the formation of a committee comprising key entities such as FSSAI, CDSCO, and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Ministry of Ayush, and the Department of Pharmaceuticals. This proposal could bring nutraceuticals under the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), making them more affordable for the general public, Local Circles said in a report.  What are the regulations in other markets?  In the US, nutraceuticals, termed &lsquo;dietary supplements&rsquo;, differ from FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-regulated drugs. They undergo post-market surveillance, without pre-approval. Manufacturers assume responsibility for safety, bypassing the need for FDA approval or product registration.  In Canada, Health Canada oversees food and drug regulations, mandating manufacturers to acquire site licences, monitor adverse reactions, and report serious incidents. Australia's regulatory guidelines detail regulations for complementary medicines, especially high-risk ones requiring regulatory evaluation for health claims. The nation's health authority assesses safety trends and risk communications for all regulated health products.  Is there any medical evidence supporting supplements?  Despite widespread consumption, there is limited evidence of health benefits related to nutraceutical or supplement usage in well-nourished adults. A recent study published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation said that dietary supplements containing antioxidants can accelerate tumour growth and metastasis. However, the risk is only when taken in excess amounts. Healthcare activists and doctors have campaigned against the over-consumption of supplements without medical advice.  Who are the players in the Indian market?  The Indian nutraceutical market, estimated to be worth around $4-5 billion in 2022, anticipates a surge to $18 billion by 2025, as per the Ministry of Food Processing Industries. Despite this growth, challenges loom, with 40,000 cases filed in 2022-23 against unsafe protein powders and supplements failing food safety norms.  Popular nutraceutical products include Revital (Sun Pharma), Ensure (Abbott), Seven Seas Seacod (P&amp;amp;amp;G) Peptamen, NutriMix, Nutrova, Curcumin Boost, Chyawanprash (Dabur), etc. Players also provide health gummies, gut health supplements, hair growth products, among others.  The Indian nutraceutical market consists of pharmaceutical companies like Sun Pharma and Dr Reddy's Laboratories and FMCG companies like Dabur, HUL, P&amp;amp;amp;G.  Vitamins and minerals accounted for 5 percent of Sun Pharma&rsquo;s total product mix in Q3FY24. Dr Reddy&rsquo;s Laboratories&rsquo; incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary for nutraceuticals, vitamins, minerals, herbals and supplements in &nbsp;September 2023.  Another listed player, JB Chemicals &amp;amp;amp; Pharmaceuticals, acquired a probiotic brand named Sporolac for Rs 628 crore in 2022. The Sporlac brand has registered a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 16 percent, as of December 2023.  A recent nationwide survey by Local Circles unveiled a significant surge in nutraceutical consumption in India, with 7 in 10 individuals opting for various health supplements. Notably, a staggering 69 percent of respondents admitted to using these products without a medical prescription.&nbsp;Local Circles&rsquo; survey received over 47,000 responses from 318 districts.","Business, CDSCO, FSSAI, India",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/whatnutraceuticalsÂ andis-government-planning-more-regulationsÂ around-them_17477091.html

The Mumbai-based Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is recalling 54,960 bottles of Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules&nbsp;from the US. It is an anti-inflammatory medicine used to treat a type of bowel disease known as ulcerative colitis.

The product was manufactured at Sun Pharma&rsquo;s Mohali unit.  The Mohali facility has been under the US FDA scanner for some time. The USFDA had directed the company to take corrective actions at the Mohali facility before further releasing final product batches into the US. According to the latest quarterly updates, some issues persist.  The American drug regulator&nbsp;stated that Ascend Laboratories (a subsidiary of Alkem Ltd.) is recalling 71,244 units of Fosfomycin Tromethamine Granule sachets. It is an antibiotic used to treat bladder infections (such as acute cystitis or lower urinary tract infections). This product was manufactured by Alkem in India.  The company is recalling the lot due to &ldquo;failed Impurities/degradation specification: out of specification for organic impurities.&rdquo;  The USFDA also stated that Mumbai-based Lupin is recalling an unspecified number of Voriconazole for Oral Suspension tablets in the US.  The medication is used to treat various types of fungal infections. Baltimore-based Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc, a unit of the company, is recalling the affected lot that was manufactured by Novel Laboratories, Inc. Somerset, USA. The company is recalling the lot due to &ldquo;incorrect or missing package Insert&rdquo;.  All three recalls were Class II recalls according to the USFDA. A Class II recall is where the use of, or exposure to the product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote, according to the US FDA.  Communications to the companies seeking response on the matter have remained unanswered.

The company is expected to report muted growth for the quarter gone by, primarily due to weak numbers from its arm Taro Pharma, muted growth in US sales due to restrictions at the Mohali and Halol sites, higher research and development spends and remediation charges.  Last week, Taro Pharma posted&nbsp;a modest 1.4 percent rise&nbsp;in revenue at $159 million.&nbsp;However, its&nbsp;net profit declined by 29 percent on year to $10 million. Increased competition and lack of meaningful launches weighed on Taro Pharma's quarterly numbers.  On the other hand, Sun Pharma is&nbsp;also facing&nbsp;challenges at its Halol plant in Gujarat, as it continues to bear the costs of remediation following an import alert issued by the US Food and Drug Administration in December of the previous year.  A poll of brokerages collated by Moneycontrol pegged the drugmaker's net profit for the quarter at Rs 2,1,19.4 crore, reflecting a marginal 2.8 growth from Rs 2,061 crore in the same period of the preceding fiscal.  An estimate of brokerages also see revenue for the drugmaker at Rs&nbsp;11,606.5 crore, a near 8 percent increase from Rs&nbsp;10,762 crore clocked in the base quarter.    Among the brokerages polled by Moneycontrol,&nbsp;Nuvama Institutional Equities had the lowest net profit projections for Sun Pharma, while&nbsp;ICICI Securities&nbsp;had the highest.  Nuvama Institutional Equities also expects&nbsp;domestic formulations growth to remain subdued in the first quarter of FY24 due to NPPA (National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority) price hike impact, patent expiry of two big products licensed from Merck and&nbsp;a weak seasonality for acute drugs.  In the US market however, most brokerages predict a&nbsp;ramp-up&nbsp;in specialty&nbsp;products like Ilumya and Winlevi and contribution from the generic of Revlimid to limit the impact of restrictions at the&nbsp;Halol and Mohali plants.  &amp;quot;Nonetheless, higher R&amp;amp;amp;D expenses and challenges in the Mohali unit may keep margins in check for Sun Pharma,&amp;quot; brokerage firm JM Financial stated in its report. On that front, Nuvama forecasted&nbsp;EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margin to come around 24 percent, an&nbsp;on-year&nbsp;contraction of 100 basis points. The firm also attributed the&nbsp;consolidation cost of Concert Pharmaceuticals and cost inflation as factors behind the pressure on margins.  Aside from the earnings, investors will also remain focused on finding out the progress made at resolving regulatory challenges at Sun Pharma's Halol and Mohali units, along with an outlook on overheads and margin for FY24.
