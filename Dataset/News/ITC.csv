While 22,000 stays possible, 22,500 may take some time to come by, says Milan Vaishnav.","&amp;quot;Going by the technical structure, Nifty IT is on its way to testing its previous high of 39,446 and may attempt to even move past that level by next quarter,&amp;quot; Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA, founder of Gemstone Equity Research &amp;amp;amp; Advisory Services says in an interview to Moneycontrol.  In the IT sector, his attention would be directed towards three specific stocks namely TCS, Infosys, and LTIMindtree.  After recent sharp correction, he says it would be wrong to say that Polycab India had a &amp;quot;downcycle&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;It is expected to stabilise from current levels and any downsides may find support at Rs 3,350.&amp;quot;  Milan, with almost two decades of experience in the capital markets, suggests that if the markets experience even a slight consolidation, the FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) sector is likely to perform well and enhance its relative performance.  Do you think the Nifty IT sector to hit record high by next quarter, considering the momentum and chart structure?  Nifty IT, while lying inside the lagging quadrant of the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG), is seeing a sharp improvement in its relative momentum against the broader markets.  Nifty IT had broken down from a bearish Head &amp;amp;amp; Shoulder formation in May 2022. With Friday's close, after a prolonged move following a decline from that formation, the IT Index has tried to move above that right shoulder. The current upmove has occurred in the Nifty IT index after trading sideways for over twelve months.  Also read:&nbsp;Budget 2024: Fiscal deficit, disinvestment and other key numbers to watch out for  Going by the technical structure, Nifty IT is on its way to testing its previous high of 39,446 and may attempt to even move past that level by next quarter.  Which are the technology stocks that you want to add into your portfolio now?  TCS, Infosys, and LTIMindtree. I would be looking at these three stocks. While TCS is displaying great relative strength. Besides this, Infosys looks at playing catchup to its relative underperformance seen in the recent past. LTIMindtree has an excellent technical setup. It is seen attempting to break out from a double-top formation and move higher towards its previous peak.  Also read:&nbsp;Stockology: As markets scale new highs, rebalancing portfolios is the most critical task  Are the charts telling you that the Nifty will hit 22,000 soon and 22,500 mark in coming weeks?  Charts are saying that Nifty is in a strong uptrend. While 22,000 stays possible, 22,500 may take some time to come by. However, about the level of 22,000, though it is possible to see that mark on Nifty, one must not forget that this possibility comes with some risks attached to it.  Nifty remains greatly deviated from its mean. The nearest pattern support stands at 21,000, the 20-week MA (moving average) is 1,679 points below from current levels at 20,215. The 50-week MA is at 19,112; a good 2,792 points from the current levels.  Do you see the Nifty Realty surpassing Rs 1,000 mark soon?  Nifty Realty stays heavily overextended on the charts. I believe it would be some time before it tests 1000-mark. If that has to happen, it should not come without some consolidation on charts. This index is highly over-extended and over-stretched.  Your top 2 bets for next week and why?  My 2 bets for the next week and onward would be defensive. ITC and Cipla. The FMCG index is in an uptrend and looks at bettering its relative performance. ITC enjoys a significant weight in the index and looks technically better placed on the charts.  Cipla has broken out from a technical pattern; after a brief consolidation, this stock too looks at resuming its upmove.  Do you expect Sobha to hit Rs 1,500 mark soon?  Sobha is currently in a robust uptrend, but it is also significantly overbought. If it surpasses the Rs 1,407 mark, there is potential for renewed momentum in Sobha. However, until it crosses the level of Rs 1,407, there is a possibility that the stock may consolidate just below that level.  Do you think the downcycle is over for Polycab India that corrected 30 percent in current month?  It would be wrong to say that Polycab India had a &amp;quot;downcycle&amp;quot;. If you look at the weekly chart, it was just the previous week that saw a sharp downfall driven the news and developments. The level of Rs 3,350 offers good support for the stock. It is expected to stabilise from current levels and any downsides may find support at Rs 3,350.  Do you expect pick in Nifty FMCG index which has been consolidating after recent correction?  The examination of the weekly charts of the Nifty FMCG index suggests that it has been in a steady uptrend; the only concern was the relative performance that was taking a back seat for some time now. If the markets consolidate even a bit, FMCG is likely to start to perform well and improve its relative performance. I expect this sector to pick up over the next few weeks.

The company, a major wheat exporter, saw its agriculture business revenue decline 25% in the April-June quarter, hit by the export bans, according to its quarterly earnings&nbsp;presentation.  Puri spoke to Bloomberg News on the sidelines of the B-20 Summit in New Delhi. The excerpts are lightly edited for clarity:  Outlook on India economy Businesses that are indexed to Indian consumption are fairly resilient. Anything that is more integrated with global supply chains, whether it&rsquo;s exports or certain commodities, there is volatility and some weakness there. What we are growing at without exports firing is a decent number.  The impact on consumption has been more inflation-led and inflation has actually been mostly imported. The second factor is climate emergency because it&rsquo;s led to crop failures. As inflation is moderating the latest Nielsen numbers also show some green shoots of pick up in the rural economy. What is to be monitored is the El Nino bit and the global dynamic is still uncertain, but as the inflation is cooling off consumption is picking up.  Impact of export bans It is impacting us. As businesses we have to be also responsible. People have to have food in the country. So we have to understand that and people have to be able to afford it. These are realities we must recognize.  I obviously hope that it is short lived. And what will enable us to export is our crops doing well, our agriculture producing more than is required so that we have the surpluses. As a responsible corporate this is what I would like to work with the farming community on and see how we can improve the produce.  Viability of agri business My focus at this point of time is on value addition (rather than pure output growth that could impact prices and overall profitability). For example, we inaugurated the spices facility and we are now going to inaugurate the nicotine derivative products facility.  That&rsquo;s the path we are on &mdash; building capacity in medicinal and aromatic plants, horticulture and aquaculture. These are the areas of value add we are focusing on as a company. And this is more value accretive than the commodity business in any case.","Business, Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/itc-chairman-hopes-india-food-export-bansshort-lived_17222181.html

The FMCG business comprises branded packaged foods, personal care products, education and stationery products, incense sticks and safety matches. It generated a revenue of Rs 19,000 crore in the financial year 2022-23, representing an annual consumer spend of Rs 29,000 crore.  Regarding the FMCG-cigarettes business, the company said after two years of disruptions due to the pandemic, the legal industry recovered during the last fiscal.  Stability in taxes on cigarettes backed by deterrent actions by the enforcement agencies enabled the legal cigarette industry to partially claw back volumes from illicit trade, according to ITC.  The company has over the years made significant investments in setting up state-of-the-art integrated consumer goods manufacturing and logistics facilities (ICML) in close proximity to large demand centers. ITC recently commissioned a new ICML at Khordha in Odisha, taking their total number to 11, the annual report said.  The company has identified exports as a new growth vector. The FMCG business expanded its export footprint spanning over 60 countries, with the production linked incentive scheme providing filip to ITC's exports across biscuits, cakes, snacks, dairy and ready-to-eat categories.  On hotels business, the report said ITC continues to leverage the 'asset-right' strategy with 120 properties and 11,500 rooms. The segment contributed around Rs 2585 crore in last fiscal with EBITDA at Rs 831 crore.  ITC is also making interventions to combat climate change by promoting 'climate smart agriculture', the report said. The programme has benefitted over seven lakh farmers in 17 states.  Green house gas emissions of select crops have been reduced by up to 66 per cent and net returns of farmers rose up to 90 per cent from 2016 to 2021.  According to the ITC report, the company continues to make significant progress in improving the circularity of waste generated in operations.","Business, Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/focussedscalingfmcg-business-itc_17108661.html
