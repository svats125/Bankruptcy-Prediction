In June, Suraksha group won the bid to acquire Jaypee Infratech, raising hopes of thousands of homebuyers that they may finally get possession of their flats after many years of delay.  This was the fourth round of bidding to find a buyer for JIL, which went into the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) in August 2017.  After the CoC's (Committee of Creditors) approval, the Suraksha group's offer has to be cleared by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

A three-member NCLAT bench has issued notices to NBCC, IDBI Bank and resolution professional of Jaypee Infratech as well as to the bourses NSE and BSE.  The appellate tribunal has directed to list the plea of minority shareholders for admission on August 17 along with another petition in the ongoing insolvency proceedings.  State-owned NBCC, which has got an approval from creditors and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to acquire Jaypee Infratech, has challenged some modification by the tribunal in its &lsquo;Resolution Plan' regarding payment to unclaimed Fixed Deposit Holders.  &ldquo;&hellip; waives and accepts notice on behalf of erstwhile &lsquo;Interim Resolution Professional&hellip; Learned counsel for the Appellant shall provide a complete set of paper-book on Respondent No 1 (RP) within a week. Let notice be issued on rest of the Respondents,&rdquo; said NCLAT bench headed by Acting Chairperson Justice B L Bhat.  In their plea, the minority shareholders have asked for exit price at fair market value.  These shareholders have urged the appellate tribunal to either set aside or modify the order passed by the NCLT approving the resolution plan of NBCC&nbsp;on March 3, 2020.  &amp;quot;The impugned order dated March 3, 2020 passed by the adjudicating authority (NCLT) be set aside/quashed or suitably modified to protect the interests of the appellants herein being the minority shareholders of the company,&amp;quot; said the petition filed through advocates Rohan Jaitely and Akshay Sharma.  The shareholders have also requested NCLAT to &ldquo;direct Respondent No 4 (BSE) and Respondent No 5 (NSE) not to delist the shares of the corporate debtor (Jaypee Infratech) till the appellants (minority shareholders) are adequately compensated by Respondent No 2 (NBCC).&rdquo;  They have also requested NCLAT to give directions to the resolution professional of the company and NBCC to &amp;quot;consider giving a fair market value of the equity shares&amp;quot; held by them.  According to them, Jaypee Infratech has adequate assets to take care of the liabilities and interests of all stakeholders, but the interest of the minority shareholders was &amp;quot;neglected&amp;quot; in the approved resolution plan.  As per the&nbsp;Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code rules, they were not involved in the approval of the resolution plan.  However, it &amp;quot;does not empower the respondents to completely ignore the interest of the minority shareholders&amp;quot;, the petition said.  The Delhi-based Principal bench of NCLT had on March 3 approved the NBCC plan to take over Jaypee Infratech and complete around 20,000 pending flats over the next three-and-a-half years.  As per the plan, the debt-laden firm will be delisted.  The petition by 30 minority shareholders said that as per the resolution plan, the entire share capital of Jaypee Infratech aggregating to Rs 1,388.99 crore would stand cancelled against a payment of Rs 1 crore and the complete ownership of the company would be transferred to NBCC by allotting all the shares for just Rs 120 crore.  &amp;quot;It is pertinent to mention here that the net worth of the corporate debtor (Jaypee Infratech) based on the fair value assessed by the valuer appointed by the resolution professional itself is Rs 8,257 crore,&amp;quot; the petition said.  &amp;quot;NCLT failed to appreciate that NBCC is attempting to acquire the corporate debtor having a net worth of Rs 8,257 crore for a paltry sum of Rs 120 crore,&amp;quot; it added.  In the present case, both the company and the minority shareholders are at a great loss, they said.  According to them, as per a valuation done by IIFCL on March 31, 2017, Jaypee Infratech's net realisable assets stood at Rs 20,277 crore and its net liabilities were Rs 9,900 crore. The amount required by the homebuyers is Rs 3,330 crore.  &amp;quot;As per the valuation done on March 31, 2017 out of the total paid-up equity share capital, there are approximately 139 crore shares out of which the minority shareholders are holding up to 25 crore shares and as per the above estimate and valuation, they should be given a minimum exit price of Rs 25-30 per share, which will not cost more than Rs 500-700 crore,&amp;quot; the petition said.  Jaypee Infratech went into insolvency proceedings in August 2017.  In December last year, a committee of creditors (CoC) comprising 13 banks and around 21,000 homebuyers, approved the resolution plan of NBCC with 97.36 per cent votes in favour.  NBCC's proposal was approved by the lenders in the third round of the bidding process to find a buyer for Jaypee Infratech. In its bid, NBCC had proposed to complete over 20,000 pending flats in housing projects launched by Jaypee Infratech in&nbsp;Noida&nbsp;and&nbsp;Greater Noida.","Business, Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/jaypee-infra-minority-shareholders-move-nclat-for-right-compensation-nclat-issues-notices_14095061.html

Order on the matter was passed by the tribunal led by OP Garg included VK Gupta and Justice PK Srivastava as co-arbitrators, on November 2.  Stating that the claimant (Jaypee Infratech) paid the amount under protest, the tribunal directed the YEIDA to refund, within three months of passing the award, the amount of Rs 41.14 crore to the company with interest at the rate of 9 percent per annum from the dates of actual payment.  The tribunal said if YEIDA failed to refund this amount within three months, then the authority would be liable to pay the principal amount and the interest, with a further interest of 12 percent per annum till the amount is actually refunded to the company.  As per the judgment, the authority had demanded Rs 2,591.78 crore in January 2015 and another Rs 247 crore in May 2017 from Jaypee Infratech as 'no litigation incentive' or additional compensation to be paid to the farmers whose land was acquired by the authority and then allotted to the developer for constructing Yamuna Expressway projects and other purposes.  But Jaypee Infratech had in its plea sought relief on grounds that these demands raised by the authority were contrary to the provisions in the concession agreement and therefore, illegal. The company sought refund of the amount paid by it along with the interest.  In the order, the tribunal also directed the YEIDA to ensure that the development work is not obstructed by the Noida development authority.  The real estate firm claimed that it had paid the Rs 41.14 crore against the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) demand under compulsion and economic duress to obtain sanctions, approvals, completion certificates from Noida Development Authority for its various real estate projects.  &amp;quot;We, therefore, have no hesitation in holding and coming to the conclusion that the claimant (Jaypee Infratech) was not at all liable and is not at all liable to pay,&amp;quot; the order said.  As per the concession agreement, Jaypee Infratech was granted a concession for a period of 36 years commencing operation from the date of August 9, 2012. Under the agreement, 25 million square metres of land was transferred to Jaypee Infratech for development of expressway as well as housing, amusement, commercial, institutional, areas.

","The Supreme Court on July 9 asked the Centre to come out with a &amp;quot;uniform&amp;quot; proposal for all cases to resolve the difficulties being faced by lakhs of homebuyers who have not yet got possession of flats despite paying huge amounts of money to real estate builders. The apex court, which was hearing a homebuyers matter related to Jaypee Infratech Ltd, said the issue concerns lakhs of flat buyers and the Centre should give a proposal to resolve it.  &amp;quot;We want suggestions from the Union of India which could be uniform for all such cases,&amp;quot; a bench comprising justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said.  &amp;quot;This issue will be bothering lakhs of homebuyers. Within the IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code), we cannot do anything. But outside it, you (Centre) can suggest something. We can consider that,&amp;quot; the bench told Additional Solicitor General (ASG+) Madhavi Divan, who was appearing for the Centre.  The bench made the observation while hearing a plea which has sought that Jaypee Infratech Ltd (JIL) be not sent into liquidation, although the deadline for the corporate insolvency resolution process is over, as it would cause &amp;quot;irreparable loss&amp;quot; to thousands of home buyers.  The ASG told the court that proper authority to respond to the plea would be the resolution professional or the bank concerned.  &amp;quot;Can some other arrangement be suggested by the Union of India without disturbing the ongoing process?,&amp;quot; the bench asked, adding, &amp;quot;We are keen to know whether you have something to suggest&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Policy issue has to be resolved by the Union of India,&amp;quot; the bench said and posted the matter for hearing on July 11.  The apex court had on August 9 last year ordered re-commencement of the resolution process against JIL and barred the firm, its holding company and promoters from participating in the fresh bidding process.  It had also allowed the Reserve Bank of India to direct banks to initiate corporate insolvency resolution proceedings (CIRP) against Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL), the holding company of JIL, under the IBC.  It had said there was &amp;quot;no manner of doubt&amp;quot; that JAL and JIL lacked financial capacity and resources to complete unfinished housing projects in which over 21,000 home buyers had not been given the possession of their flats till then.  The fresh plea filed in the top court has sought a direction that an &amp;quot;independent and thorough forensic audit&amp;quot; of JIL should be conducted from the date of its incorporation.  Referring to the apex court's last year order, the plea has said, &amp;quot;The court had made a conscious effort to avoid liquidation of Jaypee Infratech Limited. However, the events as have unfolded subsequent to the passing of the judgment have frustrated the efforts as made by the court.&amp;quot;  As per apex court's direction, the 270 days for completion of CIRP have concluded on May 6, it has said.  &amp;quot;Till date only two serious bids have been received by the Committee of Creditors. One bid has been submitted by National Buildings Construction Corporation Limited, whereas the other has been submitted by Suraksha ARC. None of the said bids have been accepted by the Committee of Creditors till date,&amp;quot; the plea has said, claiming that &amp;quot;threat&amp;quot; of JIL going into liquidation is &amp;quot;turning into a reality with each passing day&amp;quot;.  It said if no resolution plan is accepted till May 6, JIL would &amp;quot;automatically go into liquidation&amp;quot;, leaving thousands of home buyers without any remedy.

As per the direction of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), lenders are negotiating with the NBCC on the latter's bid to acquire Jaypee Infratech and complete stuck housing projects comprising over 20,000 units.  The IDBI-led lenders' consortium has written to NBCC that its bid would be considered &amp;quot;favourably&amp;quot; if the public sector firm meets its five conditions. The letter was written to NBCC on Monday, two days before the meeting of the committee of creditors (CoC).  &amp;quot;The resolution plan should reinstate 1,426 acres of land that was earlier offered to the secured financial creditors under the debt asset swap,&amp;quot; law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas has written on behalf of lenders consortium comprising 13 banks.  The land parcel should be made available to secured financial creditors pro-rata to their debt, it added.  NBCC should undertake to get the requisite approval from Yamuna Express Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) if the &amp;quot;deemed approval&amp;quot; from YEIDA as proposed in the bid for transfer of Yamuna Expressway and land to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) are not approved by the adjudicating authority, the letter said.  Lenders have also put a condition that NBCC should also undertake to get necessary nod from the Income Tax authorities for implementation of the bid if the relief sought by the public sector firm for any future tax liability is not approved by the adjudicating authority.  The creditors would consider providing financial assistance to NBCC in respect of unsold flats, provided such assistance is guaranteed by the centre.  &amp;quot;Any income tax liability or GST liability or corporate tax liability which arises in future on account of transfer of land parcels, the same shall be borne by the resolution applicant and not by the secured financial creditors,&amp;quot; the letter said.  The CoC will meet on May 30 to discuss NBCC's bid. As many as 13 banks and 23,000 homebuyers have voting rights in the committee.  Earlier this month, the CoC rejected a bid by Mumbai-based Suraksha Realty through a voting process. Later, the panel decided to put on vote NBCC's offer even as bankers were opposed to this move citing certain conditions in the resolution plan submitted by the public sector firm.  On the bankers' plea, the NCLAT had on May 17 annulled voting by homebuyers and lenders on NBCC's bid and allowed renegotiation on the offer by May 30. The voting process could start from May 31.  Sources had earlier said that NBCC was unlikely to dilute certain conditions, including exemption from future tax liability, mentioned in its bid, but the public sector firm was open to negotiating on the offer related to unsold flats.  Lenders have shown reluctance to acquire up to 2,207 unsold flats worth Rs 1,756 crore as proposed by NBCC in its revised offer.  In its latest offer, NBCC had proposed infusion of Rs 200 crore equity capital, transfer of 950 acres of land worth Rs 5,000 crore as well as Yamuna Expressway to banks and completion of flats by July 2023 in order to settle an outstanding claim of Rs 23,723 crore of financial creditors, including banks and home buyers.  On this bid, lenders had reservations on certain relief and concessions sought by NBCC and had sought clarifications from the firm.  However, NBCC decided not to dilute the conditions of exemption from future income tax liability as well as from taking consent of development authorities for transfer of businesses, including land parcels and Yamuna Expressway.  Clarifications from the NBCC were sought in the wake of Jaypee Infratech's Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) Anuj Jain flagging to the lenders that the state-owned firm's bid was conditional and non-binding because of conditions like extinguishing of tax liability and exemption from seeking YEIDA consent for any business transfer.  In 2017, Jaypee Infratech went into insolvency process after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted an application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium seeking revival of the realty firm.  In the first round of insolvency proceedings conducted last year, the Rs 7,350-crore bid of Lakshdeep, part of Suraksha Group, was rejected by lenders.  Later in October 2018, the IRP started the second round of bidding process to revive Jaypee Infratech on the NCLT's direction.","Business, Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/jaypee-infra-insolvency-lenders-put-5-conditions-to-nbcc-for-considering-bid_12581321.html

For the unsecured financial creditors, the Group has offered a transfer of land parcel totalling 1,000 acres. As for penalty/interest for possession delay, 25 percent of such amount will be paid to homebuyers, as accrued on August 9, 2017 on account of delay in delivery of possession. Further, if the Supreme Court or NCLT permits, the amount of Rs 750 crores deposited by Jaiprakash Associates for protection of homebuyers will also be utilised for the payment of balance penalties/interest.

","Realty firm Jaypee Infratech's Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) has opined that state-owned NBCC's revised bid was conditional and non-binding, which ran contrary to terms of the insolvency proceedings, sources said.  The Committee of Creditors (CoC) is scheduled to meet on Thursday (May 9) to discuss NBCC's revised offer to acquire debt-laden Jaypee Infratech.  The public sector unit has proposed infusion of Rs 200 crore equity capital, transfer of 950 acres of land worth Rs 5,000 crore to banks and completing construction of flats by July 2023 to settle an outstanding claim of Rs 23,723 crore of financial creditors.  Sources said NBCC has put several conditions for the implementation of its plan, including a demand to extinguish an estimated income-tax liability of Rs 33,000 crore over a period of 30 years arising out of the transfer of land parcels from Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) to Jaypee Group.  The IRP Anuj Jain has written to the CoC that NBCC's revised bid is conditional as the state-owned firm has stated that the plan will not be binding on it unless key reliefs such as extinguishing of income tax liability and a dispensation from seeking consent of YEIDA for any business transfer is granted, sources said.  The IRP pointed out that the insolvency process approved by the CoC in December last year provided that the resolution plans from potential bidders should be binding and non-conditional, they added.  The court-mandated deadline for completing the resolution plan for Japyee Infratech ended on May 6 and the CoC has sought an extension of the deadline. The Allahabad bench of the NCLT has posted the matter for hearing on May 21.  The CoC had on May 3 rejected a bid of Mumbai-based Suraksha Realty group, which was the lone contender after NBCC's revised offer was rejected in absence of approvals from the government departments.  NBCC has now got the approval from the relevant government authorities for its revised offer, which was submitted to the IRP on April 24. In its revised offer, NBCC has put several conditions for carrying out its commitment.  Jaypee Infratech, which is a subsidiary of Jaypee Group's flagship firm Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL), owes nearly Rs 9,800 crore to financial creditors. Also, Rs 13,839 crore has been admitted as financial debt of the homebuyers.  Sources said NBCC, in the revised resolution plan, has offered to transfer 100 per cent equity in the Expressway SPV (special purpose vehicle) -- to be created by transferring Delhi-Agra Expressway assets of Jaypee Infratech -- to the banks.  It has proposed that the banks should raise a minimum of Rs 2,000 crore against the Expressway SPV (by securitising its toll income) and provide Rs 1,500 crore from this amount to the state-owned company, which could utilise it for making upfront payments and to start construction on the stuck projects, sources said.  The plan further provides for settling Rs 9,712 crore of claims of operational creditors, including Rs 3,334 crore by the income tax department, Rs 1,689 crore towards compensation to landowners and Rs 4,423 crore to YEIDA, by paying Rs 20 crore.  Sources said NBCC has proposed Rs 62.40 crore upfront payment to buyers who had sought a refund.  During the first round of insolvency proceedings, the Rs 7,350 crore bid of Lakshdeep, part of Suraksha group was rejected by lenders as it was found to be substantially lower than the company's net worth and assets as well as the liquidation value of about Rs 14,000 crore.  Jaypee Group Chairman Manoj Gaur had promised to infuse Rs 2,000 crore to complete pending 20,000 apartments over the next four years.  The crisis-hit group had submitted a Rs 10,000-crore plan before lenders in April 2018 as well, but the same was not accepted.  JAL had submitted Rs 750 crore in the registry of the Supreme Court for the refund to buyers and the amount is lying with the NCLT.","Business, Jaypee Infratech, NBCC",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/jaypee-infratech39s-irp-finds-nbcc39s-bid-conditionalnon-binding_12474821.html

","Debt-ridden Jaypee Infratech's lead lender IDBI&nbsp;on April 29 approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking extension of insolvency proceedings beyond the May 6 deadline as the process is still underway to find a buyer for the Jaypee group's realty firm.  The bank has approached the Allahabad bench of the NCLT court to extend the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) as the deadline expires on May 6, sources said.  The NCLT has posted the matter on May 6 for the next hearing.  Earlier, the NCLT had granted extension to the lenders and Interim Resolution Professional Anuj Jain to complete the CIRP.  On January 28, the NCLT had extended the period of the CIRP by another 90 days as 180 days mandated under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was coming to an end on February 5, 2019.  Under the IBC, a resolution process has to be completed under 180 days with a further extension of 90 days to 270 days.  And if the company fails to complete the CIRP within the mandated 270 days, then the company goes for liquidation.  According to sources, IDBI requested the tribunal to deduct the litigation period at several judicial forums, which includes the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and the Supreme Court.  IDBI's plea was supported by the representative of the home buyers, who have also got the status of financial creditors after amendments in the IBC.  However, the promoters of Jaypee Infratech have opposed any move to extend the resolution period.  In 2017, the NCLT admitted the application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium seeking resolution of Jaypee Infratech.  In the first round of insolvency proceedings, the Rs 7,350 crore bid of Lakshdeep, part of Suraksha group, was rejected by lenders as it was found to be substantially lower than the company's net worth and assets.

NBCC, which has the backing of the government, is unlikely to increase the offer of Rs 500 crore capital infusion but is ready to help lenders in monetisation of the Yamuna Expressway and the land offered by the PSU in its resolution plan, they said.  A meeting of the committee of creditors (CoC) was held to discuss resolution plans submitted by NBCC and Suraksha Group. The CoC will soon formally write to both the bidders to submit revised bids based on the discussions held.  In the meeting, NBCC suggested that the company would complete and deliver stalled projects to homebuyers in three years instead of the earlier promise of four-five years, they said.  NBCC also said it was ready to work as project management consultant and charge fees for completing the stalled projects, while lenders could keep control of Jaypee Infratech, the sources said.  In its resolution plan submitted last month, NBCC offered 1,400 acre land worth Rs 6,000 crore as well as Yamuna Expressway to lenders.  It proposed that banks should raise about Rs 2,000 crore against the expressway and provide half of the amount (Rs 1,000 crore) to the state-owned company, which would utilise the fund as an upfront payment.  NBCC has offered to fund the gap of about Rs 1,500 crore between estimated construction cost and receivables from customers.  In contrast, Suraksha Group made an offer of about Rs 20 crore as an upfront payment and land worth Rs 5,000 crore, sources said. The Mumbai-based group promised to complete the pending projects in three years.  The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in 2017 had admitted the application of a consortium led by IDBI Bank seeking resolution of Jaypee Infratech, and appointed Anuj Jain as the insolvency resolution professional (IRP) to manage the company's business and invite bids from investors.

Last week, three independent directors Lalit Bhasin, Keshav Prasad Rau and Basant Kumar Goswami had resigned from the board.  Goswami resigned because of his growing age and indifferent health, and others cited personal reasons.  In a BSE filing, Jaypee Infratech said the company has received intimation dated 17th September from Sham Lal Mohan, Independent Director, conveying his resignation from the board with immediate effect for personal reasons.  The Interim Resolution Professional will place the same for acceptance in the next meeting of the Committee of Creditors (CoC).  Last year, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had admitted the application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium, seeking resolution for Jaypee Infratech under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.  The tribunal had appointed Anuj Jain as IRP to mange the company's business, who later invited bids from investors interested in acquiring Jaypee Infratech and completing the stuck real estate projects in Noida and Greater Noida.  Consequently, Lakshadweep emerged as a front runner to acquire Jaypee Infratech.  However, in May this year, lenders of Jaypee Infratech rejected the Rs 7,350 crore bid by Lakshadweep, as they found it inadequate.  Lakshadweep is a joint venture between Sudhir Valia-led Suraksha Asset Reconstruction Company and Mumbai-based Dosti Realty.  Jaypee Infratech has an outstanding debt of nearly Rs 9,800 crore, of which Rs 4,334 crore pertains to IDBI.
