This was 1.9% higher than our estimate. Revenue for 9MFY24 reduced by 1.1% YoY to INR 3,91,242 Mn. &bull; EBIT for the quarter was INR 7,030 Mn, a decline of 57.3% YoY and growth of 15.9% QoQ. EBIT margin was 5.4%, lower by 662 bps YoY and higher by 65 bps QoQ. The EBIT was 25.8% below our estimate due to higher employee benefit expenses and other expenses. &bull; EBIT for 9MFY24 contracted 51.5% YoY while EBIT margin reduced by 585 bps YoY, respectively. &bull; PAT for the quarter contracted 59.3% YoY and expanded by 3.6% QoQ to INR 5,237 Mn, missing our expectations by 35.4% due to lower EBIT and other income. For 9MFY24, PAT contracted by 53.6% YoY and PAT margin declined by 500 bps, respectively. Outlook Although Tech Mahindra has delivered poor revenue growth over the past few quarters, the sequential improvement in revenue and margins in Q3FY24 was a positive. However, high exposure to the telecom sector, where growth has been a major challenge, will continue to adversely impact the Company&rsquo;s turnaround efforts, in our view. Tech Mahindra currently trades at a PE multiple of 41.2x on FY24E/ 22.8x on FY25E EPS. We believe the new management and its ability to turnaround the business is yet to be tested. We introduce FY26E earnings of INR 74 and assign a relatively modest PE multiple of 18.3x to arrive at a slightly raised target price of INR 1,357 per share (previously: INR 1,278).

Despite these uncertainties, market analysts remain optimistic about the company's prospects, eagerly expecting insights into the turnaround strategy from the newly appointed CEO, Mohit Joshi, for the medium-term.  Over the last twelve months, the stock of this IT services company has experienced a notable surge, recording a growth of over 31 percent. This outperforms the broader Nifty IT index, which witnessed a comparatively modest rise of 23 percent during the same period.  Street awaits new CEO Mohit Joshi's turnaround strategy  Analysts at Nomura shared a 'buy' call for Tech Mahindra, with a target price of Rs 1,470 per share from last close of Rs 1,407, saying that the Q3 financials were above estimates on growth and margins were in-line with their expectations. The brokerage firm awaits full details of new CEO's turnaround strategy in April 2024.  This is the first quarter since new CEO Joshi completely took over reins of the company from former CEO CP Gurnani. Joshi restructured the organisation and the leadership team to turnaround the business, which came into effect on January 1, 2024.  ALSO READ:&nbsp;Inside Tech Mahindra&rsquo;s restructuring game plan  &amp;quot;The quarter was a mixed outcome. While this dichotomy in the markets will take its own time to settle, we are focusing internally on realigning under the new structure,&amp;quot; said the CEO &amp;amp;amp; MD.  Under Joshi's leadership, the reorganisation plan is structured around three key tracks: enhancing sales performance, improving profit margins, and restructuring the internal organisational culture.  Tech Mahindra's net profit fell by 60 percent on-year to Rs 510 crore in Q3FY24 in a seasonally weak quarter plagued by sluggish demand in key verticlas like hi-tech, telecom, and financial services. Net profit, too, saw a decline of 41 percent YoY to Rs 763 crore in Q3FY24.  Margin improvement contingent on pricing uptick  Meanwhile, the IT services operating margins saw a contraction of 164 basis points (bps) sequentially due to ongoing portfolio restructuring.  Analysts at HSBC shared a 'hold' call on the counter, with a target price of Rs 1,300 per share, sceptical of a turnaround, especially in a tough macro environment. &amp;quot;The margin expansion is contingent on pyramid improvement or a pricing uptick,&amp;quot; they wrote in a post result review analysis.  ALSO READ:&nbsp;MC Pro Quicktake: Tech Mahindra&rsquo;s Q3 results hold out hope for investors  However, Morgan Stanley analysts were 'underweight' on Tech Mahindra, raising target price to Rs 1,220 per share from Rs 1,100, saying that Q3 may mark bottoming of performance.  &amp;quot;We see the company as a good potential turnaround story candidate over the medium term.

TECHM delivered weak TCV for the second straight quarter at USD359m, down 39% QoQ after a 25% QoQ decline in Q4. Given the slowdown in Communications business across IT services peers in the last few weeks, there was a concern about a weak revenue performance from TECHM. But we were still surprised by the sharp drop in CME vertical (38% of revenues in 1Q) even after adjusting for the Comviva seasonality. While we expect the segment to return to growth in 2Q, we remain concerned about near-term demand in the space, given the adverse readthrough from the global ecosystem, including telecom hardware makers.

While the dismal levels of margin are the bottom, its recovery trajectory can be protracted. The slip in Q1 revenue of -4% QoQ was largely led by the CME vertical (38% of revenue) which dropped 9.5% QoQ, while the Enterprise segment delivered in line with peers (flat sequentially). The decline in the CME vertical was a combination of impact on network services, lower discretionary spend, and transition-delay between project completion and project/phase starts.

Outlook We downgrade TECHM to Reduce (ADD earlier) with a TP at INR 1,020 (14x Jun-25E EPS) as recovery in growth/margin may be protracted on sub-par bookings and near-term challenges in CME vertical may persist for longer (recent instances of deals from large customers going to competition as well as business challenges for telcos).

The Mahindra Group firm is likely to report a net profit of Rs 1,107 crore, representing a decline of 2.12 percent YoY, as per the average of a poll of estimates of four brokerages.  Tech Mahindra had posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,131 crore in the first quarter of the preceding fiscal FY23.  When compared sequentially, the company&rsquo;s net profit is seen contracting by 0.90 percent compared to Rs 1,117 crore in Q4 FY23.  Revenue is estimated to grow 6.23 percent to Rs 13,499 crore from Rs 12,707 crore in Q1 FY23. However sequentially, it is expected to decline from the consolidated revenue&nbsp;of Rs 13,718 crore clocked in the preceding quarter Q4 FY23.    &amp;amp;nbsp;  &ldquo;We expect TechM to report -2.3 percent QoQ decline in constant currency and -2 percent in USD -- driven by overall weak macro, lower tech spend and Q1 seasonality,&rdquo; analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities said in a note to clients.  It also expects margins to decline by 110 bps QoQ -- mainly due to wage hike, Q1 seasonality and decline in revenue.  The company&rsquo;s EBITDA margin stood at 11.2 percent in the preceding quarter and 11 percent in Q1 FY23.  &ldquo;Deal wins are expected to be modest, and so is the overall outlook,&rdquo; it added.  Choppy Waters  Foreign brokerage Jefferies expects Tech Mahindra's 1Q revenues to decline by 1.5 percent QoQ (in constant currency terms), impacted by weakness in the communication vertical, seasonal weakness at its subsidiary Comviva and overall macro weakness.  &ldquo;EBIT margin to decline by 150 bps QoQ due to revenue decline and wage hikes. Deal wins likely to be soft similar to last quarter,&rdquo; it added.  Tech Mahindra had posted a 26 percent decline in consolidated net profit for the March quarter of 2022-23, while revenue from operations stayed flat on a sequential basis and up 13 percent on-year.  In a note, Kotak Institutional Equities said Tech Mahindra is likely to post a sharp 3 percent QoQ decline in revenues in the communications vertical and flattish revenues in enterprise segment.  &ldquo;Revenue decline in communications vertical is due to seasonal weakness in Comviva and ramp down by a large telecom client. Of particular focus will be weak top five client billing,&rdquo; it noted.  Revenue decline will likely feed into margins.  &ldquo;We build in EBIT margin decline of 40 bps on a sequential basis due to decline in Comviva margin. Lack of leverage from growth is the key headwind. Utilization levels are maxed out and will provide limited tailwinds,&rdquo; the domestic brokerage added.  Dismal growth, guidance downgrades, declining headcount: How Indian IT majors fared in Q1  Analysts said the overall weak global macro and slow decision-making will likely feed into muted deal wins.  In such a scenario, the focus will shift entirely to turnaround initiatives and margin expansion strategies of CEO- Designate, Mohit Joshi, Kotak said.    The brokerage added that other key factors to watch will be the near-term growth outlook given by the firm, timing of divestments of low-margin businesses, health of deal pipeline and outlook for revenue growth in top telecom clients.  Most IT firms have posted lacklustre numbers for the June quarter, impacted by the recessionary headwinds in Europe and US &ndash; the bread-and-butter markets for the domestic IT players.  &ldquo;We expect macro-related uncertainty, likely slowdown in tech spends and supply-side pressure to impede growth in the near-term at least in 2 more quarters,&rdquo; brokerage Ashika said in a recent report.  The top five Indian IT companies (by market capitalisation) have seen their sequential revenue growth on a constant currency basis at anywhere between -2.8 percent and 1 percent, a far cry from the high single-digit and double-digit growth seen last year. The biggest shocker, however, was Infosys&rsquo; sharp guidance cut for the year from 4-7 percent to 1-3.5 percent.
