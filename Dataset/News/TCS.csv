While the 2024 growth outlook on the sector remains &amp;quot;weak at best&amp;quot;, this is not being reflected in valuations of the stocks, CLSA analysts have said.  All four stocks closed almost a percent down on March 4. At open, TCS was trading at Rs&nbsp;4,033.10 (-1.1 percent), HCL at Rs&nbsp;1,608.55 (-1.79 percent), Wipro at Rs 518.65 (-0.35 percent) and Rs&nbsp;5,177.80 (-0.75 percent).  Follow our market blog for live updates  The top-down approach to IT services sector demand outlook was reminiscent of 2019 and the 2024 guidance from global companies didn't exude confidence, it said.  The outlook for banking, retail and telecom in 2024 was almost similar to what it was in 2023. CLSA analysts said growth guidance by HCL and Infosys would be a negative catalyst for TCS, HCL and Wipro.

The bullish call came as analysts believe that the ramp-up of large deals will drive growth in the long term.  The stock of India's biggest IT services firm has surged 5.4 percent this year against a 0.7 percent rise in the benchmark Sensex. TCS hit a 52-week high of Rs 4,184 on February 9.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  Analysts at UBS expect TCS to lead its peers in terms of revenue growth by 100-150 basis points (bps). &amp;quot;TCS is likely lead its peers with improvement in margins by FY25. We believe market is not pricing in company's lead to its peers in, given a dividend consensus,&amp;quot; the brokerage firm said.  Some of the growth drivers include ramp-up large deals such as BSNL, NEST, Aviva, among others. Apart from that, revival in BFSI segment and cloud migration projects would also drive growth, analysts said.

2,TCS,2024-02-26T08:20:51+05:30,"{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/abhishek-mukherjee-29811/', 'name': 'Abhishek Mukherjee'}","A for artificial intelligence, B for base effect: The A-Z of Q3 earnings season","While some analysts and investors are still digesting the data and reading between the lines, here is a handy summary of the key trends which shaped India Inc&rsquo;s Q3 show.","The Q3 earnings season is done and dusted, with sectors like industrials, auto, energy and financials emerging as the outperformers. In contrast, consumer staples and technology companies posted lacklustre numbers.  Some names shone brighter than others. And quite a few delivered much-needed lessons in sobriety for investors drunk on this seemingly unstoppable bull run.  All in all, to borrow one of the favourite catchphrases of market experts, it was a mixed bag.  While some analysts and investors are still digesting the data and reading between the lines, here is a handy summary of the key trends which shaped India Inc&rsquo;s Q3 show.  A: Artificial Intelligence  In line with estimates, Indian IT firms delivered a weak set of numbers in the quarter gone by due to macroeconomic headwinds in the US and Europe, their biggest markets. The slowdown in discretionary spends and delays in deal conversions weighed on their topline.  However, company managements enthusiastically tried to brighten the mood during the post-earning concalls by deploying the hottest buzzword in town &mdash; artificial intelligence.  From TCS, Infosys, and Wipro to the small and midcap players, companies were at pains to highlight how they are taking the lead in generative AI.  Analysts, meanwhile, urge investors to resist the temptation of counting the chickens before they hatch.  &ldquo;Indian IT service companies see the demand for new age technology like generative AI, IoT (internet of things), machine learning, etc., despite the lack of near-term visibility,&rdquo; Axis Securities noted.  B:&nbsp; Base Effect  The aggregate earnings of BSE-500 companies were robust and resilient.  While PAT (profit after tax) growth was strong at 26%, it was down sequentially (from 58% in 2Q FY24), as the positive base effect is now dwindling, according to Emkay Research.  C: Cyclicals  Domestic cyclicals such as autos and financials, along with global cyclicals (metals and oil &amp;amp;amp; gas) drove the earnings.  Brokerage house Motilal Oswal said the aggregate earnings of the companies tracked by it rose 29% year-on-year (YoY), versus its estimate of 19%.  &ldquo;BFSI clocked 22% YoY growth (vs an estimate of 17%), while autos registered a growth of 60% YoY (vs an estimate of 34%). Metals earnings jumped 74% YoY (compared to an estimate of 25%) over a weak base of 3QFY23, led by Tata Steel, JSW Steel, and Coal India,&rdquo; it added.  D: Declining Headcount  India&rsquo;s top four IT companies &mdash; TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and HCL Tech &mdash; hired a paltry 1,940 employees on a net basis in the third quarter of FY23, down 93 percent from the previous quarter.  The net additions had fallen 45 percent to 28,836 employees in the second quarter from the first quarter, when 52,842 employees were recruited. The IT majors reported a decline in headcount for the 5th consecutive quarter, according to Jefferies.  E: Emerging Stars  One of the most heartening developments of this earnings season was the profitability of India&rsquo;s listed startups. Zomato, Policybazaar, and Delhivery, which were loss-making in Q3FY23 have come back in the black in Q3FY24. Two more &mdash; Nykaa and Mamaearth &mdash; have also grown their profits by 2X and 3X, respectively, YoY.  A conspicuous absentee from this list? Paytm, which, however, did manage to narrow its net loss to Rs 221 crore, from Rs 392 crore in the year-ago period. Of course, this once-high-flying fintech star has much bigger things to be worried about at the moment.  F: Fallen Angels  Call it the weight of expectations. Or just the law of averages catching up. But when India&rsquo;s largest FMCG company, largest paints firm, and biggest private sector lender simultaneously run into headwinds, the market takes notice.  Hindustan Unilever&rsquo;s standalone net profit increased just 0.55 percent on-year to Rs 2,519 crore, while revenue dipped 0.38 percent to Rs 14,928 crore. Both the numbers were down sequentially &mdash; a rare event for HUL. Underlying volume growth came in at a measly 2 percent, as against 5 percent for the year-ago quarter.  HDFC Bank's net profit rose 33 percent on-year to Rs 16,372 crore, but it included a one-time tax gain. Crucially, both its net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM) came in below expectations, showing the lingering impact of the merger with HDFC.  Asian Paints clocked a healthy 34 percent jump in net profit, but failed to enthuse analysts.&nbsp;Antique Stock Broking said Asian Paints&rsquo; sales performance was below expectations. In view of the demand challenges and the expected increase in competition (Grasim&rsquo;s paint sector foray), it expects moderation in volume growth momentum in the coming quarters.  G: Gross Margin Expansion  Declining raw material costs gave a lift to the gross margins of auto, cement, paints, and FMCG companies.  Gross margins across staples companies are improving as key raw material prices such as crude, palm, and packaging materials remain stable.  &ldquo;Domestic margins have climbed up to 9-quarter highs, but still some headroom versus pre-Covid levels is there,&rdquo; global brokerage firm Jefferies said.  H: Heavyweights On The March  Nifty delivered a strong beat with a 17% YoY PAT growth (versus Motilal Oswal&rsquo;s estimate of 11%). Five Nifty companies &mdash; Tata Motors, HDFC Bank, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank, and JSW Steel &mdash; comprised 56 percent of the YoY earnings growth. Ex-metals and oil &amp;amp;amp; gas, Nifty&rsquo;s earnings were up 15% YoY (versus estimates of 10%).  I: Industrials  Industrials stood out as a top performer, on both growth and margins. Capital goods firms like L&amp;amp;amp;T, ABB, Siemens, and Thermax saw a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) slowdown in order inflow but a robust 20%+ YoY growth despite a higher base, Jefferies noted.  Engineering giant L&amp;amp;amp;T&rsquo;s earnings, considered a proxy for the country&rsquo;s infrastructure development expenditure, saw 22 percent growth.  J: Jewellery Sparkles  Jewellery was one of the few segments in the discretionary basket which shrugged off demand headwinds.  ``Jewellery demand was boosted by the festive season during 3Q24, along with a rally in gold prices (16% y-y). The competitive intensity from unorganised and smaller organised players seems to have picked up, making the incumbents up their marketing spends,&rdquo; analysts at Nomura said.  Titan reported a 20 percent jump in revenue, &nbsp;to Rs 13,052 crore, but total income from its jewellery segment increased 23 percent to Rs 11,709 crore, with the Indian business growing 21 percent.  &amp;quot;We will watch the near-term consumption trend but will continue to like Titan for its best-in-class execution track record, and its hunger to keep expanding the user base. Consumers&rsquo; preference for branded jewellers will continue to keep the category growth at an attractive level,&amp;quot; Motilal Oswal said in a note.  K: K-shaped recovery  The India vs Bharat dichotomy was evident in the management commentary of FMCG and consumer discretionary players &mdash; robust demand for premium products in urban markets but continuing sluggishness in rural India. In other words, a &lsquo;K&rsquo; shaped recovery seems to be underway.  Case in point: India&rsquo;s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki, which posted a healthy 33 percent on-year jump in Q3 net profit, at Rs 3,130 crore.  &ldquo;The small car segment continued to remain muted and passenger vehicle sales volumes fell 16 percent YoY. Aided by a strong SUV lineup, the company&rsquo;s market share in the SUV segment improved to ~21 percent,&rdquo; analysts at Geojit said.  A similar script played out in the FMCG industry. &ldquo;As Indian consumers experience a rise in purchasing power, there is a growing tendency to opt for premium and branded products. This premiumisation trend is expected to be a key driver of the overall growth of the FMCG sector,&rdquo; Axis Securities added.    L: Loan Growth  Banks continued to report healthy credit growth, largely led by the retail / SME segment, with some pick-up in corporate lending. Bank credit is growing at 16 percent, faster than the GDP growth of 9 percent, implying a credit multiplier of 1.7X, Jefferies said in a recent note.  &ldquo;This is being aided by stronger growth in consumer loans, a ramp up in segments like SME, inflation-led growth in working capital credit, and some uptick in capex activity,&amp;quot; it added.  Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) too logged strong loan growth, which was, however, offset by NIM compression.  &ldquo;While sequential trends in NIM are encouraging (reflecting near bottoming), loan growth may moderate on a high base and softening momentum in select segments,&rdquo; as per Kotak Institutional Equities.  M: Mobility Booster  In 3QFY24, auto volumes (ex-tractors) grew 16% YoY (flat QoQ) led by healthy recovery in two-wheelers, stable growth across other segments, and a lower base due to a difference in the festive season. Two-wheelers witnessed the sharpest growth of ~19% YoY during the quarter.  Tata Motors saw the biggest earnings upgrade for FY24-25 in the coverage universe of Motilal Oswal.  N: Net Interest Margins  A common thread running through banks&rsquo; Q3 numbers was the pressure on the NIM &mdash; which is a measure of the amount of money a lender earns in interest on loans, compared to the amount it pays in interest on deposits.  With system liquidity tightening and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) yet to commence its rate cutting cycle, banks are forced to offer higher interest rates to attract depositors, thus putting pressure on NIMs.  &ldquo;We expect the full-year margin of this year to be similar to last year. That implies some further margin compression in Q4, but it should be much lower than what we have seen,&rdquo; Anindya Banerjee, Group Chief Financial Officer at ICICI Bank, told analysts during the bank&rsquo;s post-earnings concall.  O: OMCs Shine  State-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) had a standout quarter on the back of improved margins as a freeze on petrol and diesel prices despite a fall in crude prices helped recover losses incurred when crude was more expensive, in 2022-23.  Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) clocked a whopping 1,071% on-year jump in net profit, at Rs 8,577 crore, while BPCL and HPCL saw an increase of up to 206%.  P: Pension (Pain)  India&rsquo;s largest public sector lender had a characteristically PSU problem &mdash; hefty pension and wage bills.  SBI&rsquo;s Q3FY24 net profit plunged 35 percent to Rs 9,163 crore due to one-off additional provisions of Rs 5,400 crore towards pension, and Rs 1,700 crore for dearness allowance (DA).  Analysts, however, looked past this one-time hit to focus on the positives &mdash; comfortable loan-to-deposit (LDR) ratio,&nbsp;healthy loan growth (up 15% YoY) and pristine asset quality (net NPA ratio at just 0.64%).  Q: QSR  Despite a big sporting event (cricket World Cup) and the festive season, Q3 saw flat sequential growth for quick service restaurants (QSRs) versus mid-to-high single-digit pick-up historically.  This was likely led by low disposable incomes (indebtedness / inflation), and shift of spends to other categories like travel, according to Emkay Research.  &ldquo;While the management commentary indicated more pain for the on-premise channel (in-restaurant dining), we believe the off-premise (online) channel &nbsp;is also struggling, given the widening difference in growth for aggregators and QSRs,&rdquo; it added.  R: Rural Demand  A key takeaway from the Q3 results of consumer staple firms is the continued weakness in rural demand.  &ldquo;FMCG companies have reported muted performance due to sluggish rural demand and increased competitive intensity, affecting overall volume growth. However, there is optimism for demand recovery in the coming quarters, which will be driven by easing inflation, increased government spending, and higher remittances,&rdquo; analysts at Axis Securities noted.  At its post-earnings call, HUL&rsquo;s management said the Q3 demand trend was similar to that of Q2, with urban demand growing ahead of rural. Dabur was the only FMCG company to see higher &nbsp;rural than urban growth in Q3.  S: Stable Asset Quality  Banks had no cause for complaint on the asset quality front, with Q3 being another quarter where the non-performing asset (NPA) trends remained benign. The proportion of delinquent (overdue) loans and the stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) &mdash; those in arrears for more than 90 days &mdash; has been coming down sequentially for PSU banks.  Even the non-NPL stress book (restructured advances) has been broadly under control and not a source of worry, Kotak Institutional Equities said.  &ldquo;Gross slippages for the sector continued to be in control and have shown a decline QoQ. Slippages for frontline banks are near or even below pre-Covid levels,&rdquo; it noted. Asset quality is unlikely to be a concern for most banks in the medium term, unless there is a sharp macroeconomic downturn, which is unlikely, it added.  T: Tobacco Troubles  No earnings review is complete without mentioning the crowd favourite &ndash; ITC. The cigarettes-to-hotels major&rsquo;s December quarter revenue from operations rose 2 percent to Rs 17,651.85 crore, falling short of analyst estimates, mainly due to below par performance of its cigarettes segment.  &ldquo;At the recent analyst meet, ITC's Chairman highlighted the possibility of consolidation in near-term cigarette volumes, after reaching nearly a 10-year-high. This played out in 3QFY24, with cigarette volumes declining 2% YoY, and cigarette margins seeing headwinds from input cost inflation (tobacco, filter rods),&rdquo; Jefferies said.  The brokerage house expects volume growth to remain tepid in the near term, in the 0-3% range.  U: UnReal Estate  If you think it&rsquo;s just the equity markets which are at stratospheric levels currently, a casual chat with your neighbourhood real estate broker might serve as an eye-opener. Nifty Realty was the top performing sectoral index last year, and the bullishness was in full display during the companies&rsquo; December-quarter numbers.  Listed real estate firms saw pre-sales rise 85% YoY on strong volumes aided by new launches, and pricing growth of more than 10% in most markets, Jefferies highlighted.  The country&rsquo;s largest listed realty firm, DLF, saw a 15-year-high quarterly profit, all-time high pre-sales, and a free cash flow (FCF) of Rs 1,000 crore in the third quarter of the current fiscal year.  V: Volume Signals  Most FMCG and consumer discretionary firms reported headwinds in volume growth &ndash; offering some glimpses into underlying macroeconomic health.  &ldquo;FMCG industry volume growth at 6.4% y-y (in Q3) appears to have moderated q-q (8.6% y-y in 2Q24), but on an absolute basis it has remained the same for the past three quarters,&rdquo; analysts at Nomura noted.  Demand recovery in staples and consumer discretionary was slower than expected despite a moderation in inflation, as consumers still seemed to be cautious about spending and focussed on need-to-have consumption, with nice-to-have consumption and upgrades to better products getting stalled, it added.  W: War For Deposits  With credit growth outpacing deposit growth by a wide margin, banks are seeing heightened competition for garnering deposits.  &ldquo;Certain banks have signalled &nbsp;lower growth in bulk deposits. Thus, continued pressure on deposit mobilisation will weigh on either margins, or growth, or both,&rdquo; Axis Securities said.  According to the latest data from the RBI, term deposit rates were up ~180 basis points (bps) to ~6.8% from a bottom of ~5.0%. Both private and PSU banks had kept their term deposit rates stable for almost a year.  ``We have seen some large private banks hiking term deposit rates by 10-15 bps in the past couple of months. In our view, the outlook on NIM stays uncertain, as the competition for deposits to fund business growth could exert further upward pressure on deposit rates,&rdquo; Kotak Institutional Equities said.  X: X-Factor  If IT companies got a narrative boost through their use of &lsquo;AI&rsquo;, a consumer staples firm set the Street buzzing with some product innovation.  Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) launched its Goodknight Agarbatti, India&rsquo;s first, legal anti-mosquito incense sticks. The anti-mosquito incense sticks business is currently a Rs 1,200 crore market that&rsquo;s dominated by unorganised players. The Godrej incense stick uses a new molecule &mdash; Renofluthrin (RNF) &mdash; which is exclusive to GCPL for the medium term.  At its post-earnings call, more than half of the questions posed by analysts to the management&nbsp;pertained to this new product.  Y: YoY Trends  The earnings growth of large and midcap &nbsp;firms in Q3 was comparable as largecap grew 20% YoY, and midcaps grew 21% YoY, according to HDFC Securities.  The brokerage firm&rsquo;s coverage universe of 224 stocks saw an aggregate revenue growth &nbsp;of 5% YoY, while PAT jumped 20%. Further, 77% of &nbsp;the earnings growth came from only three sectors &mdash; energy (33%), auto (24%), and metals (20%).  Z: Zzzz  Here&rsquo;s what a typical post-earnings conference call of India Inc looks like:  Management: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning / afternoon, and welcome to our Q3 FY'24 earnings conference call. [spends the next half-hour reading out the numbers already given in the press release]. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Analyst 1: Sir, why is the EBITDA growth falling?

M: The operating environment remains challenging due to multiple domestic and global headwinds. However, we have successfully navigated the storms.  Analyst 3: So, in a way, you are saying that the worst&hellip;  M: &hellip;is behind us. Yes, thank you!  Analyst 4: [Asks a super specific question on a sub-sub-segment which contributes less than 2% to the topline]  M: I think this is a very valid question. This segment is one of our priority areas. As we have said, growth has bottomed out&hellip; [proceeds to repeat the first answer, but in different words]. So, to conclude, we can safely say that&hellip;  Analyst 4: &hellip;the worst is behind us?  M: Bravo!  Moderator: That concludes this conference.

Tata Power jumped 18 percent while Indian Hotels gained 16 percent  ,"Tata Group's combined market capitalisation crossed Rs 30 lakh crore on February 6, making it the first Indian business house ever to hit the milestone. The surge in shareholder wealth has been driven by buying interest seen in Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Motors Tata Power and Indian Hotels shares this year.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd surged over 9 percent so far in 2024 while Tata Motors Ltd advanced over 20 percent. Tata Power jumped 18 percent while Indian Hotels gained 16 percent. The Tata Group has 24&nbsp;companies&nbsp;listed on exchanges.  Meanwhile, Tejas Network, Tata Elxsi and Tata Chemicals dropped over 10 percent so far this year while the remaining stocks gained in the range of 1-5 percent.    TCS reached a new high on February 6, surging over 4 percent and crossing the market cap of Rs 15 lakh crore. The boost is attributed to encouraging deal wins in Q3FY24, with a total contract value of $8.1 billion, up 3.8 percent from the previous year. The management expressed confidence in long-term growth, anticipating client investments to increase as the challenging macro conditions subside.  TCS recently announced a 15-year partnership expansion with Aviva, a UK insurance leader, aiming to transform the &amp;quot;UK Life business.&amp;quot; Though the deal size is undisclosed, sources suggest it's a mega deal, typically exceeding $500 million. This follows a seasonally weak quarter for TCS with no large reported deals.  Tata Motors stock witnessed a surge in the past month driven by strong earnings&nbsp;with contributing factors like the easing impact of semiconductor chip shortage, lower raw material prices and robust demand. The company achieved a notable 27 percent YoY volume growth and a substantial 22 percent YoY revenue growth with the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) division posting a remarkable 16.2 percent EBITDA margin.  Despite ongoing chip challenges, JLR's supply has improved, reducing order backlog. The domestic business showed in-line results, with a 19 percent revenue growth and a significant 270-basis point expansion in EBITDA margin. New model launches and strong demand are expected to boost future volumes. The management is optimistic about sustained demand in the Indian market, driven by economic recovery and government emphasis on infrastructure development. The PV business is anticipated to continue its momentum with a projected industry growth of 5-7 percent in FY24, analysts said.  Tata Power has shown growth in 2024, aligning with the trend in the power and energy sector. The anticipation of additional momentum stems from the government's increased emphasis on expanding renewable energy use in the Interim Budget 2024. As one of the leading private sector players, Tata Power boasts a substantial clean energy portfolio of 5,500 MW, covering solar, wind and hydropower.  Indian Hotels sustained strong performance across key metrics, driven by robust demand. The optimistic future outlook from management is encouraging, leading analysts to anticipate a robust earnings trajectory in the coming years, supported by various growth factors.

This was largely driven by the company not winning any mega deals this quarter, apart from a decline in key verticals like banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and the overall market sentiment not changing despite cuts in the Fed&rsquo;s interest rate cuts. Also, Q3 is a seasonally weak quarter for the IT sector.  TCV declined from $11.2 billion reported in Q2. On a year on year basis, order book was up by 3.85 percent, from $7.8 billion.  K Krithivasan, CEO and MD, TCS said, &amp;quot;The optimism around interest rates has not resulted in a reduction of the uncertainty that we see in decision making.

As a business opportunity, Gen AI is in its &amp;quot;early days&amp;quot; right now and the use cases are smaller right now, head of the company's recently created 'AI.Cloud' unit Siva Ganesan told PTI.  The company, which had disclosed a few months ago about being engaged in 250 generative AI powered projects, is also using the intelligence gleaned from Gen AI for making its ongoing work for clients faster, he added.  &amp;quot;So it's probably smaller use cases right now.

When asked for a targeted time period by when it plans to finish the staff training on Gen AI skillsets, Ganesan declined to specify but added that one can easily do the math given the current rate of training, under which it has trained over 1.50 lakh staffers in the skillsets in about seven months.  &amp;quot;We are very confident to create one of the world's largest AI-ready workforce for the future so that I think we can safely say that with a high degree of confidence,&amp;quot; its chief technology officer Harrick Vin said.

The IT sector helped Nifty reach record highs as heavyweights TCS and Infosys gained sharply on Friday, January 12, 2024. Reliance Industries also supported the rally as it has been trading near record highs for the past three trading sessions. Further, we can see healthy sector rotation, where different sectors are contributing to the upmove.  Going by the Elliott wave, prices are currently in wave iii of (v). Hence, it is best to use dips as buying opportunities, unless there is any close below the support level of 21,580 (what to do then, not buy?). A close above the immediate psychological hurdle of 22,000 will further extend the short-term upmove.  In short, the Nifty has just broken out from the flag pattern, and may further accelerate towards 22,118 levels. As long as it is above 21,580, buying on dips can be a prudent strategy.  Nifty Hourly chart:    On the weekly charts, Nifty IT, in the week starting December 11, 2023, broke through the resistance of 34,000 and has managed to hold and close above that level for the past four weeks. On Friday, the index formed a bullish candle and closed above three weeks of consolidation. It &nbsp;is approaching the key resistance level of 36,800. A breach above this can trigger fresh buying in the IT sector and take Nifty IT to a lifetime high of about 40,000. The momentum is strong, so there is a high possibility that the upward journey will continue.  In short, the IT sector looks bullish.  NIFTY IT weekly chart    What to Pick in IT Sector  Tata Consultancy Services  On Friday, TCS had a 3 percent &nbsp;gap-up opening and closed at the highest point on the weekly chart. TCS has formed a strong bullish candle after three weeks of consolidation. Further upside may be seen above Rs 3,930, with prices reaching an all-time high of around Rs 4,045.  On the daily charts, the stock is near an important resistance zone &mdash; Rs 3,905 to 3,930 &mdash; and any closing above the latter will indicate fresh buying in TCS. The stochastic RSI (relative strength index) has formed a bullish crossover, suggesting a bullish bias.  Thus, the larger bullish trend is intact.  Info Edge India  Naukri has formed an inverted head and shoulder pattern on the daily charts and it is on the edge of a breakout from the same. A close above Rs 5,387 is needed to confirm the breakout, after which, a good rise is expected in this stock.

But on the other hand, the market has reacted very positively to the muted earnings, which hints at strong expectations that the market has for the IT sector to recover in the coming quarters. With this expectation in mind, IT could be a good value pick at these levels, she believes.  Sonam, with more than 10 years of experience in quantitative research and portfolio management, feels 2024 holds the potential for being a moderately positive year for the Indian equity markets.  Do you think the most of negative news are behind for the technology sector that boosted the benchmark indices to new highs?  The technology sector, having weathered a storm of challenges including a global economic slowdown, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical tensions, shows signs of a potential turnaround. Recent market movements suggest that investors might be seeing a light at the end of the tunnel, possibly indicating that the bulk of negative news could be behind us.  This optimism could be attributed to several factors. Firstly, there's a possibility that inflation rates might stabilise, leading to less aggressive monetary policies, which historically benefit tech stocks. Additionally, tech companies have been adapting to economic shifts through cost optimisation and efficiency improvements, potentially stabilising or even improving their financial performance.  Also read:&nbsp;Ensure laptop import policies do not restrict trade: US tells India  The sector's fundamental drivers, such as demand for cloud computing, AI, and digital transformation services, remain robust, underpinning long-term growth prospects. Positive developments in major economies could bolster confidence, but uncertainties like geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions still loom.  What do you make out of numbers reported by IT biggies - TCS, Infosys, and Wipro?  The recent financial results from IT giants TCS, Infosys, and Wipro paint a nuanced picture of the sector's current state and future prospects. TCS and Infosys, leading the pack, have shown resilience amidst challenging global economic conditions. TCS reported a steady year-on-year revenue and profit growth, although with a slight dip in EBIT margins, reflecting the impact of macroeconomic factors like wage inflation and currency fluctuations. Infosys, on the other hand, delivered better-than-expected results, indicating robust operational efficiency and client engagement strategies.  Also read:&nbsp;SEC charges Morgan Stanley, former executive Pawan Passi with fraud  Wipro, while facing similar macro challenges, has shown varying degrees of impact in their financial performance. Wipro's potential revenue decline, possibly mitigated by strategic cost-cutting measures, suggests a focus on maintaining profitability in tough times.  These results collectively indicate that while the IT sector is not immune to global headwinds, companies are actively adapting through operational efficiencies, cost optimisation, and strategic focus on high-growth areas like digital transformation and cloud services. The sector's resilience is also underscored by the strong order books and steady deal inflows reported, suggesting sustained demand for IT services.  Are the commentaries by leaders of TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies giving you enough confident to add IT stocks to portfolio now?  The commentaries from the leaders of TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and HCL Technologies paint a picture of resilience and strategic adaptation in the IT sector, crucial for investors considering IT stocks. Their focus on areas like digital transformation, cloud services, and automation, coupled with strong order books and steady deal inflows, suggests a sector adapting well to global economic challenges.  Also read:&nbsp;8 stocks that stand to profit from &lsquo;Affluent India&rsquo;, according to Goldman Sachs  However, the cautious outlook expressed, particularly regarding macroeconomic uncertainties and their impact on IT spending, indicates a landscape of opportunities tempered with risks. The market on the other hand has reacted very positively to the muted earnings, this hints at strong expectations that the market has for the IT sector to recover in the coming quarters.&nbsp;With this expectation in mind, IT could be a good value pick at these levels.  Do you think the upside is being capped in the HDFC Bank?  The anticipated Q3 results for HDFC Bank, with a projected 32.5 percent YoY increase in net profit and a 26.8 percent rise in net interest income (NII), reflect a robust financial performance. However, the question of whether the upside for HDFC Bank is capped hinges on several factors. Firstly, the market often prices in expectations ahead of actual results. If investors have already factored in these strong results, the immediate upside potential of the stock might be limited.  Also read:&nbsp;Investors will soon be able to block their trading account to stop suspicious activity  Additionally, the broader market context, including economic conditions and sector-specific trends, plays a crucial role. The banking sector is currently navigating through a landscape marked by rising deposit costs and potential margin pressures, which could temper investor enthusiasm.  Furthermore, the bank's performance relative to its peers and the overall market sentiment will influence its stock movement. While HDFC Bank's strong fundamentals and growth trajectory are evident, these external factors could cap the stock's short-term upside.  Do you expect the China market to bottom out this year?  The significant decline in Chinese stocks, as evidenced by the MSCI China Index, has led to attractive valuations, potentially enticing investors looking for undervalued opportunities. This interest is a positive sign, suggesting some belief in a market recovery.  However, several uncertainties cloud the outlook. The Chinese economy is still navigating the repercussions of its real estate debt crisis and facing challenges related to regulatory changes and consumer confidence. Additionally, the global economic landscape, including factors like inflation and monetary policy shifts in major economies, could influence investor sentiment towards Chinese markets.  While the current low valuations might hint at a potential market rebound, the recovery's timing and extent remain uncertain. The market's future trajectory will likely hinge on how effectively China addresses its internal challenges and adapts to the evolving global economic environment. Therefore, while there's a possibility for improvement, confidently predicting a bottoming out within this year is challenging, considering the diverse and interconnected risks.  What is your reading on the December inflation numbers?  The December inflation and November industrial production numbers reflect the ongoing challenges and dynamics within the Indian economy. Inflation rising to a four-month high of 5.69 percent in December underscores the persistent pressure on consumer prices, particularly in the food segment. It remains slightly above the RBI's target range, necessitating continued monitoring and policy adjustments.  Will it (2024) be a moderate year for the Indian equity markets?  2024 holds the potential for being a moderately positive year for the Indian equity markets. There are several factors that instill confidence: Firstly, the Indian government's commitment to domestic reforms and substantial infrastructure spending initiatives is expected to stimulate economic growth. Secondly, India's demographic advantage, characterized by a young and growing workforce along with a burgeoning middle class, remains a strong driver for consumption-led growth.  Lastly, the liquidity boost resulting from potential central bank interest rate cuts can significantly influence the performance of the Indian equity markets in 2024.  Moreover, on the global stage, India's role in diversifying global supply chains, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic, could attract foreign investments. However, it's important to temper these positives with a dose of caution. Valuations in the Indian equity market have been relatively high, risk of geopolitical tensions, global supply chain snags could limit the scope for significant expansion.

Amid this, investors will eye Nifty's move towards the 22,000 mark after having hit a new high of 21,834.  For the week ended January 5, the Nifty ended 0.1 percent lower at&nbsp;21,710 while&nbsp;Sensex ended 0.3 percent lower at 72,026.&nbsp;Within sectors, Nifty Realty (up 7.8 percent) and Nifty Media (up 3.3 percent) were the top gainers while IT (down 1.9 percent) and Metal (down 1.3 percent) were top losers.  The broader market sustained its outperformance for the second straight week. Nifty Midcap 100 gained 2.5 percent while Nifty Smallcap 100 gained 1.9 percent. However, analysts believe that investors must stay cautious ahead of results season and persisting uncertainties in Red Sea.

Here are 10 factors to watch:  Q3 earnings  According to BSE earnings calendar, about 65 companies are slated to release their results between Jan 8 to Jan 13. Among Nifty 50 companies, TCS (Jan 11), Infosys (Jan 11), HCL Tech (Jan 12), Wipro (Jan 12) and HDFC Life Insurance (Jan 12) will declare their December end results.  Analysts at Elara Securities expect the IT firms to post muted results, with an average constant currency (CC) growth of 1.4-1.6 percent in dollar terms.  The muted sequential growth in the December quarter due to prolonged higher inflation, delay in discretionary projects and a sluggish growth. The October-December period is typically a slow quarter due to the holiday season in the US and European countries, which are the biggest markets for Indian IT firms.

Headline CPI is estimated to rise 0.3 percent month-on-month for December. As per reports, a similar monthly increase of 0.33 percent is expected for core CPI, which removes changes in food and energy prices. The inflation trajectory will determine how long will US Federal Reserve keep rates higher, while it has already indicated that three cuts&nbsp;could happen this year.    Red Sea Crisis  The crisis is not showing any signs of abating, with Houthi rebels continuing to attack commercial ships in the Red Sea as Israel-Hamas conflict deepens. Shipping giant Maersk has already said that it will divert all vessels away from the Red Sea for the foreseeable future, warning customers of disruptions.  The increasing Red Sea crisis may impact trade as it is expected to push shipping costs by up to 60 percent and insurance premium by 20 percent, a report by economic think tank GTRI said on January 6. In India, government officials met shipping companies last week to assess the impact of the situation.

Meanwhile, Brent futures gained 2.2 percent to&nbsp;settle at $78.76 a barrel.  &amp;quot;With the tensions in the Middle East, the geopolitical trading premium has to get pushed higher,&amp;quot; John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC told Reuters. &amp;quot;It's hard for traders to fight the headlines.&amp;quot;  Domestic Economic Data Points  On the domestic front,&nbsp;CPI inflation for the month of December scheduled to be released on January 12 will be closely watched. Most experts expect the inflation to be increasing by around 10-20 bps from 5.5 percent reported in November due to likely increase in food inflation but sees core inflation moderating further a bit from 4.05 percent in November.  Apart from CPI, industrial production data for November, foreign exchange reserves (for week ended January 5) and bank loan &amp;amp;amp; deposit growth (for fortnight ended December 29) will also be released on January 12.

FIIs bought equities worth Rs&nbsp;3,290.23 crore in the week gone by while DIIs sold Rs 7,296.50 crore.  FII inflow follows the trend of last two months of 2023, as foreign investors made a return&nbsp;thanks to the sharp decline in US bond yields and declining dollar.  &amp;quot;In December, FPIs were big buyers in financial services and also in IT. FPIs also bought in sectors like autos, capital goods, oil and gas and telecom. Since 2024 is expected to witness further declines in U.S. interest rates, FPIs are likely to increase their purchases in 2024 too, particularly in the early months of 2024 in the run up to the general elections,&amp;quot;&nbsp;Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services said.

Immediate resistance is anticipated at 21,800 and 21,900, said&nbsp;Arvinder Singh Nanda, Senior Vice President, of Master Capital Services.  To this, Pravesh Gour, senior technical analyst at Swastika Investmart added that if Nifty&nbsp;manages to sustain above the 21,800 mark, then 22,000 and 22,200 will be the next target levels.  &amp;quot;Bank Nifty is respecting its 20-DMA around the 47,800 mark. On the upside, 48,500&ndash;48,800 is acting as an immediate supply zone; above this, we can expect a move towards the 49,500&ndash;50,000 level. If it slips below 20-DMA, then 47,000 will be the key support level,&amp;quot; Gour said.  F&amp;amp;amp;O Cues  Options data indicated that the 21,800 is expected to be an immediate resistance for the Nifty 50 as clearance of the same may possibly take the index beyond 22,000 mark, while the 21,700-21,500 is the crucial support area.  On the options front, 22,500 strike owned the maximum Call open interest, followed by 23,000 strike and 21,800 strike, with meaningful Calll writing at similar strikes in similar sequence, while on the Put side, the maximum open interest was visible at 21,000 strike, followed by 21,500 strike, and 21,700 strike, with writing at 21,700 strike, then 21,000 strike &amp;amp;amp; 21,500 strike.  Meanwhile, the volatility dropped sharply during the last week, after consistently rising for previous five weeks, making the trend favourable for bulls.

The management indicated that a demand slowdown due to macro concerns is leading to reprioritization of deals, which is resulting in pauses and deferrals in non-critical projects.

The company reported operating profits of Rs 13,755 Cr with operating margins at 23.2% (a decline of 130 Bps). This was on account of wage hikes, higher visa and other operating costs. Attrition levels did drop by 220bps but they stood at 17.8%, looming concerns over the company&rsquo;s execution efficiency in the future. The management commentary on the verticals BFSI, Hi-tech Media, Life Sciences, and Retail was cautious. Furthermore, it expects the company to report moderate growth in the near term. On a brighter note, deal-wins for the quarter continued strong and remained high. Moreover, deal wins were spread across verticals and across geographies and stood at $10.2 Bn (BFSI TCV at $3 Bn, Retail TCV at $1.2 Bn). However, TCS expects technology spending to remain resilient and expects the secular tailwinds to drive healthy growth over the medium term to long term.
