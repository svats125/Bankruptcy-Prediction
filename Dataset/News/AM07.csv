Here&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a look at key features of the policy.,"The government on Wednesday cleared the National Mineral Exploration Policy which aims to boost private sector participation in mineral exploration. Following the announcement, stocks of private mineral explorers like Maithan Alloys, Sandur Manganese and Indian Metals surged on the bourses. Though the industry cheered the move, some mining players have sought clarity on the processes and amendments made. Here&amp;amp;rsquo;s a look at key points of the National Mineral Exploration Policy (NMEP). Mining Thrust NMEP will pave way for auction of 100 prospective mineral blocks. It boosts India&amp;amp;rsquo;s mining potential. It allows private mining companies to carry out regional and detailed exploration of mining blocks. Earlier, private explorers used to apply for mining leases which would then be given out on a first-cum-first-serve basis. The new policy does away with that and all participants will now have to bid for mining blocks through an auction. Revenue Sharing About 2 percent of royalty will be set aside for National Mineral Exploration Trust. The policy allows host states a share in revenue from mineral exploration. Revenue sharing model for exploration to be lump sum or an annuity basis payment. Auction Quandary A 100 prospective mineral blocks to be e-auctioned post exploration. While managements of some companies like Ashapura Minechem expect auctions to take place in the next few months, others like Sandur Manganese&amp;amp;nbsp;have raised questions on the workflow of prospecting which may delay&amp;amp;nbsp;the auctions. Prospecting is a largescale effort undertaken by explorers to find viable mineral reserves. The industry wants clarity on points such as...  How prospecting processes will be conducted. How does government select entities for the process. What are the parameters that determine viability and potential of mining blocks. Which companies get prospecting licences.  &amp;amp;nbsp;Compiled by Chaitanya Gudipaty","Ashapura Minechem, Auction Quandary, Business, Indian Metals & Ferro Alloys, Maithan Alloys, mineral, Mining Thrust, NMEP, Revenue Sharing, Sandur Manganese and Iron Ores",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/national-mineral-exploration-policy-a-quick-read_6948701.html
