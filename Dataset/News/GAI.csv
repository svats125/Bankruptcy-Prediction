Despite persistent attempts to breach crucial resistance, each effort led to a sell-off, resulting in a consolidation trend within the 21,500-21,750 range, indicative of sideways movement. Weekly support remains robust at the 21,400 levels, while the upper Bollinger band presents resistance at 21,850.  In the previous week, the Bank Nifty experienced a notable 3.36 percent loss, closing at 46,058. The key technical indicator, the 20-day simple moving average (SMA), stands at 47,100, serving as a formidable resistance level. Additionally, the 200-day moving average (DMA) at 44,500 acts as critical support with a breach below these levels could intensify selling.  Noteworthy is the robust performance of the PSU Banking sector pack, which recorded a commendable 3.3 percent gain during the week. This surge played a pivotal role in bolstering bullish sentiment across banking stocks.  Pre-budget sentiment might lead to more volatility this week, as there are just three trading sessions and all eyes are on Bank Nifty, which is in oversold territory. There's an anticipation of a potential rebound from lower levels, especially within the private banking stocks.  Here are three buy calls for short term:  GAIL India: Buy | LTP: Rs 166.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 158 | Target: Rs 180 | Return: 8 percent  The GAIL India has recently experienced a significant breakthrough, marking a horizontal trendline breakout on the daily scale. This breakout was not only notable for its technical significance but was also accompanied by a remarkable surge in trading volume, surpassing three times the 50-day average volume.  Adding to the bullish sentiment, the stock displayed a substantial bullish candle on the breakout day, further reinforcing the strength of this upward movement.  The stock is currently trading at an all-time high level, supported by a convergence of positive signals from various technical indicators. All moving averages and momentum indicators are aligning to suggest a strong bullish momentum in the stock.  Both the daily and weekly relative strength index (RSI) is firmly situated in a higher zone indicating stock may zoom higher from the current levels. The MACD histogram is signalling a pickup in upside momentum, adds yet another layer of confirmation to the positive outlook.  Hence, based on the above technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP Rs 166.5 for a target price of Rs 180. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 158.  Indian Hotels Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 479 | Stop-Loss: Rs 460 | Target: Rs 522 | Return: 9 percent  The Indian Hotels Company is currently trading at Rs 479, demonstrating a consistent upward trend within a positive rising channel. This bullish movement is further supported by its short-term moving averages of 20 and 50 indicating a favourable short-term momentum.  Additionally, weekly RSI stands at 74 and is trending upward suggesting increased buying participation and positive investor sentiment. Furthermore, the stock has recently surpassed a significant trendline resistance which had been acting as a formidable supply zone. This breakout is a strong indication of a potential upward surge in the stock price.  Hence, based on the above technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP Rs 479 for a target price of Rs 522. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 460.

The deal would be part of GAIL's plans to lock in new supply contracts by 2030 to diversify its gas imports and hedge against supply disruptions like those seen after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, when LNG prices surged to a record high.  Neither state-controlled GAIL nor QatarEnergy responded to Reuters requests for comments.  GAIL had to cut gas sales to some local industries last year after supplies under its long-term deal with the German unit of Russia's Gazprom were hit when it was taken over by Berlin, which diverted volumes to its own market.  Qatar, the world's top LNG exporter, is looking to sign record volumes of long term sales contracts this year as it expands market share globally at the expense of Russia.  GAIL, India's largest pipeline operator, would be the second local company to sign a deal with Qatar. Petronet LNG, part owned by GAIL, is also negotiating an extension to beyond 2028 of its long-term LNG deal, under which Qatar supplies 8.5 million tons per year (tpy) of LNG.  A deal with GAIL would strengthen prospects for the renewal of Petronet's deal at better pricing, said one of the sources, adding India's target is to sign the two deals by end-September.  GAIL is looking to buy 1 million to 1.5 million tpy of LNG from QatarEnergy, the sources said.  Indian companies are investing billions of dollars to build gas infrastructure and scouting for long-term deals to raise the share of natural gas in the country's energy mix to 15% by 2030 from about 6.5% now.  GAIL plans to buy an additional 7 million to 8 million tpy of LNG by 2030 but does not intend to depend on one country for more than 1 million to 2 million tpy of that to avoid the risk of sudden disruption, its head of finance Rakesh Jain said on Monday.  The company has two existing contracts to buy a combined 5.8 million tpy of LNG from the United States and a 2.5 million tpy supply contract with SEFE, the former German Gazprom unit.  Asia has outpaced Europe in locking in long-term supply from Qatar's two-phase expansion plan that will raise its liquefaction capacity to 126 million tpy by 2027 from 77 million.  Qatar has so far signed three LNG supply deals with buyers in China and Bangladesh and is also in advanced talks with Thailand's state energy firm PTT.","Business, Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/gail-close-to-finalising-qatar-lng-purchase-deal-report_17153651.html

Gas transmission EBITDA grew strongly by 4.6x q-o-q to Rs. 1,351 crore, reflecting a 7.5% q-o-q rise in gas transmission volume and benefit of tariff revision. Gas marketing EBITDA at Rs. 1,103 crore (up 1.9x q-o-q) was supported by better margins. The petchem segment was hit by lower HDPE prices; LPG-LHC segment witnessed recovery but missed estimate. Potential higher tariff and strong volume guidance (123 mmscmd/138-140 mmscmd by end-FY24/FY26) would drive sustained healthy growth for gas transmission business while gas marketing EBITDA guidance of Rs. 3,500 crore is encouraging. Petchem may take time for complete turnaround given subdued petchem prices. Outlook We maintain a Buy on GAIL with a revised SoTP-based PT of Rs. 135 (reflects higher value for gas transmission). Valuation of 6.5x FY25E EV/EBITDA is at steep discount to historical average of 8.4x and stock offers a healthy dividend yield of 4-5%.

GAIL&rsquo;s p/l tariff was recently (Mar&rsquo;23) revised upwards to Rs 58.6/mmbtu, however GAIL is of the view that tariffs need further upward to Rs 68.55/mmbtu. Many pipelines are getting commissioned in FY24 which will result in increase in volumes.

Gas transmission EBITDA of just Rs. 297 crore was affected by several one-offs totaling Rs. 730 crore, while petchem EBITDA losses remained high at Rs. 257 crore, as it still has impact of global LNG supply concern. The gas trading/LPH-LHC segment posted a strong q-o-q earnings recovery supported by higher volume/margins for the trading biz and lower cost for LPG-LHC segment. After a dismal FY23 performance, we expect GAIL&rsquo;s earnings to witness a strong recovery in FY24 supported by an improving outlook across its business. Gas transmission to benefit from higher tariff/volumes; petchem to turnaround on improved LNG supply and lower gas cost while LPG-LPG margin to improve from APM gas price cap. Management expects gas trading EBITDA of Rs. 3,500 crore in FY24. Overall, we expect 79% y-o-y PAT growth for GAIL in FY24.  Outlook We have been neutral on GAIL since Q1FY23 due to earnings concern because of volatile LNG supply/price post Russia-Ukraine conflict. We believe that major headwinds are over for GAIL with normalizing LNG supply/price and thus we upgrade GAIL to Buy (from Hold) with an increased PT of Rs. 128.

INR15.1b) due to high feedstock costs in petrochem segment and a weak performance in transmission segment due to one-off items. The transmission segment saw an adverse impact of ~INR8b in FY23 due to de-allocation of domestic gas for compressor fuel. This is not expected to continue going forward as GAIL has already represented the issue to PNGRB and recovery is expected to happen in subsequent tariff revision. Additionally, the management expects incremental benefits of INR15b in the transmission segment due to an increase in tariffs to INR58.6/mmBtu in FY24 from ~INR43/mmBtu in FY23. Transmission volumes are also expected to increase to 118mmscmd in FY24 from 107mmscmd in FY23.  Outlook The stock trades at a ~34% discount to its one-year forward long-term P/E average.

GAIL&rsquo;s p/l tariff was recently (Mar&rsquo;23) revised upwards to Rs 58.6/mmbtu, however given notified tariff factors for a lower price (than the prevailing prices) for APM &amp;amp;amp; HPHT gas to be used as SUG, GAIL is of the view that tariffs need further upward revision to factor for the same. In light of the revised NGPL tariff regulations (Nov&rsquo;22), the cost of SUG as fuel is recoverable as operating cost and therefore, we foresee a high probability for revision in pipeline tariff to adjust for the same.

The state-owned company's chairman and managing director SK Gupta said, &amp;quot;For this fiscal, we plan to spend Rs 10,000 crore&amp;quot;.  He added that even though FY23 was not good for internal resource generation, it invested Rs 9,100 crore, which was 15 per cent higher than the budgeted levels.  He exuded confidence that FY24 will be robust on the internal resource generation front, and there will not be any problem with continuing with the capex.&nbsp; &amp;quot;We plan to borrow something around Rs 5-7,000 crore,&amp;quot; he added.  The company's director of finance, RK Jain, said that given the present scenario in global finance, the borrowing will be done domestically and not in global markets.&nbsp; Keeping in line with the Sebi mandate, a fourth of the borrowings will be in bonds while the rest will be bank borrowings, he said.  At present, the company's overall long-term debt stands at Rs 9,800 crore, and the new bank borrowings will be for a tenor of over five years.&nbsp; It is in the domestic market to raise a borrowing of Rs 1,500 crore right now, he added.  Meanwhile, Gupta said Gail has initiated legal proceedings against Russian energy giant Gazprom for failure to supply Liquified Natural Gas following the complications arising out of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  &amp;quot;We are taking up legally against them to press for specific performance and to claim the damages, and our request for arbitration has been filed...in the London court,&amp;quot; Gupta said.  Without divulging the exact sum that the company is claiming, Gupta said Gail has recommended its representatives for the arbitration, while its supplier is yet to appoint one.  He said normal supplies have been on for the last two months, but the price being paid by Gail is higher than the spot market prices because the contract entails a price, which is an average of nine months.  Gupta also said that the company is looking seriously at entering the solar energy components space, and will be looking at all the options, including tie-ups.&nbsp; It is also confident of commissioning a green hydrogen production in the calendar year 2023 itself.  The company is also contemplating entering into the ethane cracker, but the plans are still on the drawing board.&nbsp; Gupta said it will not be looking at pipeline monetisation because oil and gas companies are able to raise necessary resources from the markets.","Business, capex, Companies, GAIL",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/gail-to-borrowto-rs-7000-crore-domestically-to-fund-rs-10000-crore-capex-planfy24_17014501.html
