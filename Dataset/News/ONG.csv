Follow our market blog for live updates  According to the report,&nbsp; Indian upstream stocks like ONGC and Oil India have &amp;quot;proven to be strong value plays in recent months&amp;quot; with both ONGC and Oil India trading higher as a result of&nbsp; robust production growth guidance. Over the last one year, ONGC stocks have gained around 77 percent, while Oil India has gained nearly 2x.  Analysts at Motilal Oswal expect to see another 15-20 percent of &lsquo;value upside&rsquo; left in both these stocks as investor attention for both stocks will move to&nbsp;&amp;quot;assessing volume growth scenarios, analysing operating costs and the strength and visibility of the exploration and development pipeline&amp;quot; instead of valuation. This could lead to some rerating.  Also read:&nbsp;India exported $6.65 billion oil products derived from Russian oil to sanctioning nations: Report  While Motilal Oswal is positive on both the stocks, analysts prefer Oil India to ONGC due to its &amp;quot;exposure to the refining upcycle led by its stake in Numaligarh Refinery Limited, and higher core oil and gas volume growth&amp;quot;. ONGC on the other hand, the report says has more growth challenges and is dependent on&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;quot;more offshore-oriented projects&amp;quot; that have a longer gestation period.

Independent analyst Prakash Diwan also said that the recent surge in Singapore GRMs (gross refining margins) indicates a positive outlook for RIL's O2C business.  &amp;quot;This marks a valuation reset for RIL, which is currently under-owned by FIIs. As FIIs sell&nbsp;HDFC Bank, IT and FMCG stocks due to bleak outlook, they will redirect funds elsewhere. And, RIL will be a big beneficiary,&amp;quot; he said.

ONGC has started producing from the Cluster-2 project in KG-DWN-98/2 block and will slowly ramp up output.  Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said &amp;quot;first oil production commences from complex and difficult&amp;quot; block.  He did not indicate the current output but said &amp;quot;production is expected to be 45,000 barrels per day and over 10 million standard cubic metres per day of gas&amp;quot;.  Cluster-2 oil production should have begun by November 2021 but was delayed because of the Covid pandemic.  ONGC has hired floating vessel Armada Sterling-V, owned 70 per cent by SPOG (Shapoorji Pallonji Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas) and 30 per cent by Malaysia's Bumi Armada, for producing oil from below seabed.  The FPSO (floating production, storage and offloading vessel), Armada Sterling-V, has been waiting to receive oil since January 2, 2023, after she was hooked up on December 27, 2022.  ONGC previously set May 2023 as the first Cluster-2 oil deadline, extended to August 2023, September 2023, October 2023 and finally December 2023.  ONGC's KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries' KG-D6 block in the KG basin, has a number of discoveries that have been clubbed into clusters. It is situated offshore the Godavari river delta in the Bay of Bengal.  It is located 35 kilometres off the coast of Andhra Pradesh in water depths ranging from 300-3,200 metres. The discoveries in the block are divided into three clusters -- Cluster-1, 2 and 3. Cluster 2 is being put to production first.  Cluster 2 field is divided into two blocks namely 2A and 2B, which as per the original investment decision were expected to produce 23.52 million metric tonnes of oil and 50.70 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas over the life of the field.  Cluster 2A was estimated to contain reserves of 94.26 million tonnes of crude oil and 21.75 bcm of associated gas, while Cluster 2B is estimated to host 51.98 bcm of gas reserves.  Cluster 2A was anticipated to produce 77,305 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and associated gas at a rate of 3.81 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) over 15 years.  Cluster 2B is expected to produce free gas of 12.75 mmscmd from eight wells and has a 16-year life.

As per earlier guidance, management expects oil production from KG-DWN98/2 to commence by Aug&rsquo;23 in an optimistic scenario and by Oct&rsquo;23 in a worst-case scenario. The peak oil production is likely to be ~40-45kbopd. Although the levy of windfall tax by the Center with a fortnightly revision raised concerns on realizations of upstream companies, the government has adjusted windfall taxes in line with crude oil fluctuations. Our estimate suggests that the government is allowing a post-windfall realization of USD68-81/bbl and we expect it to remain at ~USD70/bbl from 2QFY24 onwards. The implementation of the Kirit Parikh Committee's recommendations from Apr'23 has provided the much-needed respite to the company, as it had to sell gas below the cost of production for quite a long time. We build in gas price assumptions of USD6.7/mmBtu for FY24-FY25E. Additionally, ~6-8% of APM gas production comes from new wells that will attract 20% premium as per the new pricing policy.

Net profit of the state-owned oil and gas explorer came in at Rs 17,383 crore in Q1, compared to Rs 8,581 crore in the year-ago period.  However, the company&rsquo;s standalone net profit tanked 34 percent to Rs 10,015 crore in the quarter, from Rs 15,206 crore in last year.  Revenue from operations declined 10 percent to Rs 1.63 lakh crore in the June quarter, as against Rs 1.82 lakh crore in the same period last year,&nbsp;ONGC said in an exchange filing.  Crude oil output of the company declined 3.3 percent to 5.311 million metric tonnes (MMT) from 5.495 MMT in year-ago period. Similarly, gas output was 3 percent lower in the quarter compared to last year.  The company said output in the quarter declined on account of shutdown in Panna-Mukta offshore platforms and cyclone Biparjoy.  &ldquo;The reduction in ONGC's production output in Q1 FY 2023-24 was due to: a. Shutdown in Panna-Mukta offshore platforms for commissioning of new crude oil pipeline to modernise its evacuation facilities, post taking over from JV Partners. b. Cyclone Biparjoy (June 2023) disrupted offshore and onshore production. c. Crude oil wells in southern India had to be stopped as a refinery there stopped receiving oil, following a leakage in their pipeline,&rdquo; the company said in a press release.  ONGC said current output decline was temporary and it would be compensated in the upcoming quarters.  To counter the decline in production from some of the matured and marginal fields, the company is taking proactive steps by implementing well interventions and advancing new well drilling activities, said ONGC post-results.  &ldquo;The current decline in production is temporary. The same will be compensated in upcoming quarters with commencement of additional production from new projects; especially by crude oil production commencement from KG 98/2 in Q3 2023-24,&rdquo; the company said.  In the first quarter of FY24, ONGC declared total four discoveries (1 in onland and 3 in offshore) in its operated acreages. Out of these, 3 are prospect (offshore) and 1 pool discovery (onland).

These include a 49.9 per cent stake in the Vankorneft oil and gas field and another 29.9 per cent in the TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha fields.,"India's flagship overseas firm ONGC Videsh has less than USD 100 million of dividend income lying&nbsp;in Russia because of Ukraine conflict but the company is not in a hurry to bring it back, a senior official said on Monday.  Indian state oil firms have invested USD 5.46 billion in buying stakes in four different assets in Russia. These include a 49.9 per cent stake in the Vankorneft oil and gas field and another 29.9 per cent in the TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha fields.  They get dividends on profits made by the operating consortium from selling oil and gas produced from the fields. Soon after invading Ukraine in February last year, Russia put restrictions on repatriation of dollars to check volatility in foreign exchange rates.  OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), got its last dividend back in July 2022. One dividend payout that came after that is lying in the company's account in Russia.  Its managing director Rajarshi Gupta said the dividend income lying in Russia is &amp;quot;less than USD 100 million.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We are not in a hurry to get it back as the company has capital and operating expenses for the three projects in Russia,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;It is business as usual as far as dividend is concerned.&amp;quot; OVL holds interest in Russia through a Singapore subsidiary.  Moscow declared Singapore as an unfriendly nation last year and so money from Russia cannot flow to any company incorporated in that country.  He said the company is looking at right banking channels and discussions are on. Last week, Oil India officials said USD 300 million dividend income of the company and its partners are stuck in Russia.  The consortium of OIL, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat PetroResources Ltd has stakes in two projects.  The USD 300 million dividend was lying with the Commercial Indo Bank LLC (CIBL), which was a joint venture of State Bank of India and Canara Bank. Canara Bank in March sold its 40 per cent stake in CIBL to SBI.  The dividend from TAAS was paid on a quarterly basis, while Vankorneft's earnings were paid half-yearly. The Indian firms are looking at options of how to repatriate the money from Russia, he said.  OVL holds a 26 per cent stake in Suzunskoye, Tagulskoye and Lodochnoye fields -- collectively known as the Vankor cluster in the north-eastern part of West Siberia.  Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Bharat PetroResources Ltd (a unit of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd or BPCL) hold another 23.9 per cent in Vankor. Russia's Rosneft is the operator with 50.1 per cent interest.  The consortium of OIL, IOC and Bharat PetroResources has a 29.9 per cent stake in TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha. The operations of the fields have not been impacted and they continue to produce as normal.  OVL also has a 20 per cent stake in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field in Far East Russia, and in 2009 acquired Imperial Energy, which has fields in Siberia, for USD 2.1 billion.  OVL, which has 32 oil and gas properties in 15 countries from Venezuela to Vietnam, had seen oil production fall to 6.349 million tonne in 2022-23 fiscal (April 2022 to March 2023) from 8.099 million tonne in the previous year.  Gas output also dipped to 3.822 billion cubic meters from 4.231 bcm in 2021-22. The lower production was because of halting of operations at Sakhalin-1 for seven months after operator Exxon declared force majure post Ukraine war.  But higher oil prices help it post a net profit of Rs 1,700 crore in FY23 as against a PAT of Rs 1,589 crore in the previous fiscal.","Business, Companies, ONGC, ONGC Videsh, Russia",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ongc-videsh-has-less-than-36100-million-stuckrussia-says-official_17043571.html

On a standalone basis, the company reported a net loss of Rs 248 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 2023 (Q4FY23), compared to the Rs 8,860 crore net profit recorded in the same period of the previous year.  Standalone gross revenue for the state-run oil and gas major increased by 5.2 percent to Rs 36,293 crore from Rs 34,497 crore in the year-ago period.  The company said that its bottom line was hit due to a provision of Rs 12,107 crore made in the quarter towards disputed Service tax and GST on royalty and interest on it in the period between April 1, 2016 and to March 31, 2023.  The company also said that this has been done as a prudent practice, adding, &ldquo;it shall continue to contest such disputed matters before various forums based on the legal opinion&rdquo;.  The company's Board has recommended a final dividend of Rs 0.5 per equity share for FY 2022-23.&nbsp;The total dividend for FY&rsquo;23 would be 225% (Rs.11.25 per share of face value Rs 5 each) with a total payout of Rs. 14,153 crore.

Among these, three are prospects (two on land and one offshore), while five are pools (three on land and two offshore).  The crude oil (Nominated) realisation for the quarter stood at $77.12 per barrel which is down by 18.8 percent compared to the realisation of $94.98 per barrel during the corresponding period last year.  In rupee terms, the average crude realisation was Rs 6,344 per barrel, 11.2 percent down year-on-year (YoY).  Total crude production during the quarter remained at 5.23 million metric tonnes (mmt) compared to 5.39 million metric tonnes (mmt) produced during the same period a year ago.  The gas production during the quarter was down 1.5 percent on-year to 5.26 billion cubic metres (BCM) compared to 5.33 BCM a year ago.  The production of value-added products dipped 18.7 percent on-year to 612 kilotonnes (KT) from 753 KT.  ONGC's 4Q FY23 standalone EBITDA significantly declined due to various factors: a sharp increase in dry well write-off, lower net crude realization, and a substantial exceptional expense for disputed taxes, said JM Financial Institutional Securities. Production at OVL--wholly owned and overseas subsidiary--gradually recovered, and there was a higher PAT due to the reversal of an impairment charge. The final dividend was limited, leading to a 40 percent payout for FY23. PAT estimates for FY24 and FY25 were reduced, resulting in a revised target price, it said. Despite this, the brokerage firm has maintained its &lsquo;buy&rsquo; rating on ONGC stock due to the attractive dividend yield and the market price discounting lower net crude realisation.","Buzzing Stocks, ONGC, ONGC Q4 results, Q4 results, Results",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/ongc-shares-slide-4-as-consolidated-net-profit-declines-53q4_17037761.html
