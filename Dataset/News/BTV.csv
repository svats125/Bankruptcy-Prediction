Riyank Arora | Technical Analyst at Mehta equities Ltd  Here's what Riyank Arora of Mehta Equities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Bharti Airtel  The stock is giving a breakout from its falling wedge pattern and showing overall good signs of momentum and strength. With the overall trend being positive and a sharp volume pick-up in the counter, it is expected that the stock should head higher towards potential targets of Rs 1,190 and Rs 1,200 with a strict stop- loss at Rs 1,140 mark.    Balaji Amines  The stock has given a good breakout above its recent swing high mark of 2345. Volume in Tuesday's session was nearly 14 times its average 30-day volume.  The next resistance, as per technicals, is now placed at Rs 2,490 mark above which upside would open towards Rs 2,689. A strict stop-loss should be kept at Rs 2,300 for all active longs on the stock.    Solar Industries  The stock is approaching a crucial breakout mark of Rs 7,832.90 on its daily as well as weekly charts. Any move above Rs 7,835 should trigger a major upside move in the stock towards Rs 8,000 and Rs 8,200 levels.  A strong support is placed at Rs 7,400 mark, below which the stock would lose its strength, so a stop-loss can be kept at the same.

In our view, this is a reason for investors to pay more attention to a cheaper part of the Indian market, namely state-owned enterprises,&amp;quot; said Wood in his latest 'GREED &amp;amp;amp; Fear' note.  The Nifty PSE index has rallied 110 percent in the last one year. State Bank of India has gained 31 percent in the last one year, while Life Corporation of India has gained 74 percent. Hindustan Aeronautics has surged 147 percent in the same period.  Earlier this week, PM Modi&nbsp; lauded the increased public confidence in public sector units (PSUs) under the BJP-led NDA government. In an address to the Rajya Sabha, Modi noted that the net worth of India's PSU companies has surged by 78 percent since 2014, and their shares are now yielding favourable returns.  Before that, last week,&nbsp;Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also highlighted that the government was all in to improve the valuation of PSUs, in an exclusive interview with Network18. Government-owned companies have historically traded at discounts to their private peers. However, in the last couple of years, they have closed the gap.  Portfolio changes  Wood has announced adjustments to the India long-only portfolio, ahead of upcoming general elections. In the India long-only portfolio, a new investment in Bharti Airtel will be introduced, accounting for 3 percent weight.  This addition will come by&nbsp;reducing the investment in Reliance Industries by three percentage points. The allocation to HDFC Bank will be reduced by two percentage points.  Investments in Axis Bank and State Bank of India will each be increased by a percentage point.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  As for the global long-only portfolio, Wood reduced investment in HDFC Bank by two percentage points, while that in Axis Bank and TSMC were increased by a percentage point each.    Wood wrote in his note that the interim&nbsp;budget&nbsp;was a&nbsp;pleasant surprise to GREED &amp;amp;amp; Fear, his much followed column. &amp;quot;It is testament to the confidence of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the pending general election in April-May that his government announced a budget on 1 February that is almost devoid of vote-buying populism,&amp;quot; he wrote.  With&nbsp;government capex set to increase 17 percent year-on-year to Rs 11.11 lakh crore in FY25, Wood reiterates L&amp;amp;amp;T&nbsp;GREED &amp;amp;amp; Fear's 6 percent weighting in that stock in the India long-only portfolio and a 5 percent position in the Asia ex-Japan long-only portfolio.  &amp;quot;It has been an ongoing feature of Modi&rsquo;s government that the fiscal deficits have been used mainly to finance infrastructure investments rather than transfer payments,&amp;quot; he said.

The firm expects the government's social spending, excluding subsidies, will rise by approximately 7-8 percent in FY25, compared to a 4 percent increase in FY24.  By increasing social expenditure but decreasing capex growth, the government will try to contain fiscal deficit at 4.5 percent of the GDP by FY26.  &amp;quot;We estimate FY25E fiscal deficit target at 5.2 percent of GDP. Assuming the tax revenue growth at ~12.5 percent, the total expenditure growth would have to be limited to ~7-8 percent,&amp;quot; Jefferies said.
