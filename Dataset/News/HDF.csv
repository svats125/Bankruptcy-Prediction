After the requests from HDFC Bank, RBI had in April permitted the transfer of shareholding of the Corporation in HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company, to HDFC Bank. And advised that HDFC or HDFC Bank should increase the shareholding in HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO to more than 50 percent prior to&nbsp;the effective date of the scheme, the RBI said.  Later, fair trade watchdog CCI on June 20 and insurance regulator IRDAI on June 23 had granted their approval to HDFC to raise its stake in HDFC Life beyond 50 percent.

The clarification from HDFC came hours after its chairman Deepak Parekh announced these two dates.  On April 4 last year, the board members of HDFC approved the scheme of amalgamation. As per the scheme, subsidiaries HDFC Investments and HDFC Holdings will be merged with the promoter HDFC, and then HDFC will be merged with HDFC Bank.","Business, HDFC Bank, HDFC Life Insurance Company, Housing Development Finance Corporation, Market news",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/hdfc-makes-hdfc-lifesubsidiary-by-raising-its-stake-to-5033_17097251.html

However, the company is likely to see strong loan growth and healthy operational performance.  Net interest income (NII) is expected to rise nearly 5 percent on-year to Rs 4,752 crore, the average of estimates showed. The housing finance major is scheduled to release its earnings on May 4. The board might also consider dividends for existing shareholders in the meeting.

Overall, loan growth is lower at 11 percent due to slower growth in the non-individual segment. Core net interest margins (NIMs) will likely expand marginally (up 5 bps QoQ), reflecting recent rate hikes.  ICICI Direct expects HDFC to witness loan growth of 15 percent YoY to Rs 6,51,060 crore, led by healthy demand for home loans. Hence, growth in NII is seen at 15 percent YoY to Rs 5,024 crore. NIMs are likely to remain steady despite the competitive intensity. Provisions to decline marginally YoY at Rs 391 crore leading to standalone profit growth of 6.3 percent YoY (4.8 percent growth QoQ) to Rs 3,868 crore.  Motilal Oswal Securities expects healthy growth in HDFC&rsquo;s asset under management (AUM) at 13 percent YoY. It estimates margins to remain largely stable sequentially. The pre-provision operating profit is set to grow 7 percent YoY, and credit cost is likely to be at 25 bps.

The non-bank lender's net interest income grew 7 percent on-year to Rs 4,284 crore, ahead of Street's estimate of Rs 4,107 crore.  The higher-than-expected growth in net interest income was driven by the strong performance of the individual loans business, which on assets under management basis saw a 16 percent growth in the reported quarter.  &amp;quot;The demand for home loans and pipeline of loan applications continues to remain strong. Growth in home loans was seen in both, the affordable housing segment as well as in high-end properties. The increasing sales momentum and new project launches augur well for the housing sector,&amp;quot; HDFC told stock exchanges.  The strong growth helped the company's overall assets under management to grow 12 percent on-year to Rs 6.2 lakh crore.  HDFC said that December saw the second-highest monthly disbursement of individual loans in the history of the company.  The collection efficiency for individual loans on a cumulative basis witnessed an improvement to stand at an average of 98.9 percent during the quarter ended December, the company said.  However, the non-bank lender saw a deterioration in its asset quality on a reported basis, as gross bad loans rose to Rs 12,149 crore from Rs 10,341 crore in the previous quarter.  Similarly, gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio stood at 2.32 percent at the end of the reported quarter, against 2 percent in the previous quarter.  In the individual loans portfolio, the GNPA ratio was at 1.44 percent, whereas it was at 5.04 percent for non-individual loans.  Out of the total gross bad loans, Rs 2,746 crore worth of loans are less than 90 days past due as on December 31, the non-bank lender said.  &amp;quot;Hence, as against the reported bad loans, the NPLs net of loans that are less than 90 days past due as at December 31, 2021 is: individuals 1.14 percent, non-individuals 3.87 percent &nbsp;and total portfolio: 1.81,&amp;quot; HDFC said.  The loans restructured under the RBI&rsquo;s Resolution Framework for COVID-19 related stress were equivalent to 1.34&nbsp;percent of the loan book.  Shares of HDFC&nbsp;were up 1.7 percent at Rs 2,609.95 on the National Stock Exchange.","Housing Development Finance Corporation, Results",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/hdfc-q3-results-|-net-profit-rises-11-yoy-to-rs-3261-crore-beats-estimates_15995981.html

The decline in profits of the non-bank lender will be on account of lower dividend income in the quarter as well one-time capital gains of close to Rs 160 crore in the year-ago quarter, analysts said.  The country&rsquo;s largest housing finance company is expected to report a mere 2.6 percent on-year growth in net interest income (NII) to Rs 4,107 crore likely because of the lacklustre performance of the non-individual loan segments.  On the individual loan side, the performance is likely to be strong. Kotak Equities expects a 16 percent year-on-year rise in the loan book of individual loans.  Analysts expect the strong growth in the individual loans segment to drive assets under management higher by 12-16 percent on-year in the quarter.  On the operating front, the performance is expected to be muted. The company&rsquo;s pre-provision operating profit is seen falling 2.9 percent on-year to Rs. 4,222 crore in the December quarter due to higher costs and muted NII growth.  Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services said that HDFC&rsquo;s margins will contract sequentially due to moderation in blended yields and negative carry of liquidity coverage ratio requirements.

The formation of a doji candle on September 6, which signifies indecision in the market, followed by another doji on September 7 suggests consolidation in the near term is a likely scenario and Nifty can trade within a broader range of 17,450 to 17,200 in the coming few days.  The trend, however, still remains positive therefore a buy on dips strategy is still the best strategy at this juncture.  IT, FMCG, capital goods, real estate and consumption are the sectors that remain positive and are expected to push the index higher.  Nifty Bank underperformed Nifty on September 7, after showing some strength in the last week. However, it is still in the positive territory above 36,200 which is expected to offer strong support.  Nifty Bank may witness buying in the near term after it has seen a small correction.  We recommend a buy around 36,200 for the target of 36,800-37,000, maintaining stop loss below 37,000.  Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  HDFC | LTP: Rs 2,833.20 | Target price: Rs 2,950 | Stop loss: Rs 2,750 | Upside: 4%  The stock is on the verge of a breakout from a rounding bottom formation on the daily charts.  It also gave a breakout from a pennant formation on September 7.  On the derivatives front, fresh long additions has been seen in the past few trading sessions at the same time call unwinding activity took place at 2,800 strike which was holding the highest open interest (OI).  Dixon Technologies (India) | LTP: Rs 4,330.05 | Target price: Rs 4,500 | Stop loss: Rs 4,220 | Upside: 4%  The counter has shown sideways consolidation over the past few sessions after giving a V-shape recovery.  The price pattern is suggesting that post this short breather, the stock is once again ready to move higher.  Short term moving averages (20 and 50 EMA) are placed below the price and are acting as good support for the stock.  Also, there has been a buy crossover in the leading indicators pointing towards an upside move in the coming days.  Maruti Suzuki India | LTP: Rs 6,878 | Target price: Rs 7,150 | Stop loss: Rs 6,760 | Upside: 4%  After a prolonged correction, this stock is finally looking poised for giving a sharp upside move in the short term.  After a good rally, the stock has been consolidating within a small triangular pattern for the past few days, while short-covering activity was clearly visible on the derivatives side during the same period.  Besides, we expect auto stocks to do a catch-up rally and Maruti looks poised to lead from the front.​  (The author is VP- Research at Globe capital)  Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.
