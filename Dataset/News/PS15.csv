Deal win TCV was at a record high (USD 521m), aided by strong wins and renewals in North America. EBITDA margin at 17.7% (up 90bp QoQ) beat our estimates; the improvement was attributed to seasonality in IP business and SG&amp;amp;amp;A optimization. PSYS&rsquo;s 3QFY24 revenue performance was positive, although the growth was skewed toward Healthcare and Life (up 16% QoQ); the other two verticals reported muted growth. Despite a seasonal furlough, the deal TCV recorded yet another quarter of strong growth, up 8.8% QoQ (vs +26% QoQ in 2Q), translating to 1.7x BTB.

EBIT Margin at 15.4 %, improved by ~80 bps q-o-q led by currency benefits and easing of supply side pressure offset by headwinds from furloughs, seasonality and an increase in travel and facilities cost. Company reported strong deal wins for Q3FY23 with TCV of deal wins at $440million, up 20% q-o-q and Book-to-Bill ratio at 1.7x. New business TCV reported for the quarter was $239, up 5% q-o-q while Total ACV stood at $326.3 million, up 20% q-o-q. The management indicated that decline in revenue from top client has bottomed out and that the company expects revenue growth of at least over 30% for FY23. The management also stated that the company is well placed to maintain the quarterly deal win run-rate at above $400 million going ahead. Outlook Despite strong bookings and sustained acceleration in deal wins, the near-term outlook for FY2024E looks uncertain due to persisting global headwinds with gradual recovery coming in the next few quarters. However, we believe the structural growth story for Indian IT sector is intact and hence we maintain a Buy rating on Persistent Systems with revised PT of 5010 (to reflect the rollover of target multiple to FY25E EPS).

Key positives include (1) deal bookings, which were at an all-time high&mdash;both renewals and net-new TCV, which provides adequate growth visibility (9MFY23 net-new ACV ~55% of revenue-rate) and positive commentary on Q4 order bookings; (2) focus on larger deals with annuity and progress in client mining, reflected in USD 5mn+ client count increasing from 30 in Q2 to 34 in Q3 and continued increase in revenue per account (up 50% since pre-covid); and (3) recovery expected in T2 accounts, which has been a growth headwind in recent quarters (T50 accounts ex-T2 grew ~8% QoQ). PSYS attaining its margin aspiration of 200-300bps increase in 2-3 years is an upside risk to our estimates.  Outlook Maintain BUY on PSYS (top pick in mid-tier IT) with a TP of INR 5,230, valued at 32x Sep-24E EPS. Valuation drivers (currently at 28.5x FY24E) include industry-leading 25% EPS CAGR over FY22-25E, ~50% RoIC and improving FCF and payout.

Revenue grew 3.4% QoQ, despite impact of the higher-than-usual furloughs (150bps), lesser working days (50-100bps) and weakness in select clients. Management expects furloughs to extend into the next quarter and impact revenue growth by 50-75bps in Q4. Revenue growth was broad-based across Software, Hi-tech &amp;amp;amp; Emerging industries (4.1% QoQ; ex-top client: 7.7%), Healthcare &amp;amp;amp; Lifesciences (2.9%), and BFSI (2.8%). The services business has posted 9.2% CQGR in the last eight quarters, and Management remains confident (albeit watchful of macro uncertainties) about sustaining the growth momentum on the back of continued demand, robust deal intake (USD440mn in Q3; 1.7x book-to-bill), healthy deal pipeline, new logo additions, and steady progress in client mining. Management expects EBITM to expand by 200-300bps over the next 2-3 years, ahead of our expectations, on the back of revenue growth, flattening pyramid, SG&amp;amp;amp;A leverage with progress on client mining, and large deals traction. Outlook We raise our EPS by 1%-8% for FY23E-25E, factoring-in the Q3 performance and higher margin assumptions. We retain BUY with TP of Rs4,500/share at 25x Dec-24E EPS (earlier Rs4,125).

Tail winds came from the IP-led business, which surprised, absorbing almost half of the fall. The EBIT margin rose 27bps q/q, absorbing 230bps of the wage-hike impact and was 72bps higher y/y. TCV touched $368m, up 30% y/y and net new TCV was up 53% y/y; no slow down yet. Management intends to maintain growth; margins would improve as supply challenges seem to be behind.  Outlook We revise estimates ~10% driven by TCVs and margins. Target increased to Rs.4,410 (23x FY25, earlier Rs.4,290).

Despite macro-overhang the management indicated that demand is robust, and it does not see any delay in decision making process on deals. Utilization rates at 79.9% for Q2FY23 improved by 40 bps compared to Q1FY23. Key verticals and geographies have continued to grow in Q2FY23, but some moderation in growth was visible as compared to Q1FY23. The management cited that clarity on impact of furloughs would be known only in mid-November.
