Volume growth was healthy at 5.5% YoY, supported by grammage additions even as the no. of packets sold grew by ~3.0% - 3.5% YoY. Price cuts were to the tune of 4.0% YoY/ ~2.0% QoQ. Revenue for 9MFY24 was INR 1,26,999 Mn, a growth of 3.4% YoY. EBITDA for Q3FY24 was flat on a YoY basis at INR 8,211 Mn (-5.9% QoQ). EBITDA was 2.8% higher than estimated due to further lowering of input costs. EBITDA margin contracted by 19 bps YoY/ 39 bps QoQ to 19.3%. For 9MFY24, EBITDA grew by 17.4% YoY while EBITDA margin expanded by 222 bps YoY. PAT for the quarter was INR 5,564 Mn, a decline of 40.3% YoY/ 5.3% QoQ, impacted on a YoY basis due to exceptional items in Q3FY23. Adj. PAT was flat YoY and declined by 4.8% QoQ due to the muted topline. Adj. PAT was 3.0% higher than our estimate aided by better operating performance. For 9MFY24, PAT was INR 16,015 Mn, a decline of 9.2% YoY. Adj. PAT grew by 15.6% YoY to INR 16,044 Mn. BRIT is focusing on driving volume growth and gaining market share through a combination of price cuts, grammage addition, innovations, brand investments, distribution expansion, and higher growth in the non-biscuit portfolio. As a result, the Management believes that the EBITDA margin has likely peaked. We believe BRIT will see high single digit/ low double-digit revenue growth in the next 2 years along with range-bound margins driven by operating efficiencies, premiumization and cost rationalization.  Outlook We revise our FY24E/ FY25E Adj. EPS estimates by +2.5%/ 0.4%, respectively as we factor in a high-single-digit revenue growth in FY25E along with largely stable margins. We introduce our FY26E estimates and expect a Revenue/ EBITDA/ Adj. PAT CAGR of 7.7%/ 11.1%/ 12.2% respectively over FY23-FY26E. The stock is currently trading at 55.0x/ 48.6x/ 43.1x our FY24E/ FY25E/ FY26E Adj. EPS, respectively. We apply a P/E multiple of 47.0x to FY26E EPS of INR 114.2 (50.0x to FY25E EPS of INR 101.1 previously) and arrive at the target price of INR 5,367 per share (INR 5,094 per share previously), implying an upside of 8.9% over the CMP.

The net profit is seen at Rs 566 crore, as per a poll of six brokerages, as against Rs 556.8 crore in the year-ago period.  Analysts&nbsp;see muted growth in Q3 FY24 on the back of a high base (anniversarisation of price hikes), some price cuts, high competition and low single-digit volume growth. This will restrict revenue growth at 3 percent YoY at Rs 4,303 crore for the quarter.  On the lower end of the range, Kotak Institutional Equities and Axis Securities expect 1-2 percent growth in topline while BNP Paribas' estimate is on the higher side.  It is also important to note that Britannia had an exceptional gain of Rs 359 crore in the base quarter.&nbsp;If that is included, then net profit in Q3 FY23 works out to about Rs 932 crore. In that case, this quarter's net profit estimate looks like a fall of 39 percent YoY.  The net profit in base quarter included an exceptional gain due to the&nbsp;joint venture agreement with (France's)&nbsp;Bel SA for the cheese business.

Axis and Kotak peg volume growth at 1 percent, while Motilal and Yes Securities&nbsp;see it at 3 percent. Meanwhile, JM Financial expects volume growth at 4 percent YoY.  Since there is no major risk on the commodity front, brokerages expect gross margin to improve by an estimated 60 basis points sequentially. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. However, EBITDA margin at 19.23 percent is expected to decline on a YoY and QoQ basis.  &amp;quot;We estimate EBITDA margin to decline 110/70 bps qoq/yoy off a high base (1) lower employee costs boosted EBITDA margin in Q2 FY24, and (2) Q2 FY23 EBITDA margin was aided by wheat forward covers and about 40-50 bps benefit pertaining to prior period PLI incentives,&amp;quot; Kotak Institutional Equities noted.

Moreover, competition intensified amidst the lower raw material prices. However, the management has guided volume recovery in FY24 on account of rural expansion, increase grammage, and price cuts. EBITDA margins are likely to remain at the current level and the management does not expect meaningful recovery owing to price cuts along with higher ad-spends and increased start-up costs on account of continued capacity expansion in the company&rsquo;s existing plants (Ranjangaon &ndash; Dairy expansion, Bihar and Orissa) &bull; Though Q1FY24 results were below our estimates, we believe the worst is behind for the company as 1) Raw material prices of palm and packaging costs are in a downward trajectory (though they are still firm for wheat and sugar prices), 2) Ruralled distribution expansion and focused approached in Hindi belt region is expected to help the company gain market share, and 3) Rural revival is expected in the coming quarters, supporting recovery. Moreover, BRIT&rsquo;s long-term prospects remain strong as the management has a proven execution track record, robust portfolio planning through NPD in core and adjacencies, and a focus on continued distribution expansion in direct as well as rural markets.

BRIT continues to increase distribution and gain share in core Biscuits &amp;amp;amp; Bakery segment and scale adjacencies &amp;amp;amp; innovations like Nutrichoice Herbs, Cakes, Croissants, Milkshakes and Milk Bikis etc with sales scaling up 20-50% QoQ. We expect benign input cost scenario with Palm oil (down 44% from peak), wheat procurement at near MSP prices for FY24 despite firm outlook for prices of liquid milk and sugar. We believe EBITDA margins are near peak as BRIT will increase promotions/grammage to ward off competition and impact of PLI incentives goes down in FY24 (Rs700mn v/s Rs1.35bn in FY23). BRIT&rsquo;s long term growth drivers are intact with 1) 28k rural preferred dealers (26k in 4Q22) 2) rising share of MT sales with improved mix 3) higher growth in focus states 4) cost efficiency gains in manufacturing, distribution and procurement 5) sustained innovation program and 6) Rs11-12bn capex over FY23 and FY24. Outlook We estimate 11.8%/15.0% sales and PAT CAGR over FY23- 25. We roll over to 45x Mar25EPS and assign a target price of Rs4,800 (Rs4,580 earlier). Retain Hold.

","Biscuit maker Britannia Industries is expected to report a 32-percent year-on-year growth in its consolidated net profit at Rs 498.4 crore, when it announces its Q4 results today. According to a poll of brokerages, revenue&nbsp;from operations is seen growing 13.5 percent to Rs 4,029 crore.  That said, net profit will decline over 46 percent from last quarter, which included a one-time gain from a stake sale in the dairy subsidiary.  &ldquo;Revenue growth will be aided by market share gains from Parle, traction in new launches, distribution expansion, particularly in rural markets, and likely bottoming of the rural slowdown,&rdquo; according to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities.  On the operating front, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) is seen growing 28 percent to Rs 703 crore. And, margins might expand 200 basis points to 17.5 percent.  One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  High wheat and milk prices continue to remain a major concern for the company. The makers of the popular&nbsp;Good Day biscuit took 10 percent price hikes in the quarter gone by, so analysts are expecting 3-4 percent volume growth, which is similar to Q3 FY23.  With HUL slightly missing Street estimates but Nestle posting its highest-ever revenue growth in 10 years, all eyes are now on Britannia&rsquo;s Q4 numbers. Investors will be keenly eyeing management commentary on raw materials, ad spending demand and volume trends. Progress in new segments like croissants and marble cakes is also a key monitorable.  In the past month, the stock has gained close to 6 percent. On May 4, the stock closed at Rs 4,578 on the NSE, higher by 1.12 percent from the previous close.
