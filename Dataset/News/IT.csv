It also offers application development, product co-development, system implementation and system engineering services. In Q3FY24, revenue remained broadly flat (up 1.3% YoY) at Rs. 38,821 cr as higher growth in the manufacturing and life science segments was partially mitigated by a decline in the financial services and communication segments. EBITDA margin fell 90bps YoY to 23.5% on account of the McCamish cyberattack incident and salary hikes. The seasonally weak quarter has been further impacted by lower discretionary spends and lower demand for digital services, which we believe is temporary.

EBIT margin declined 70bp QoQ to 20.5%, marginally ahead of our estimate. Profitability was aided by a lower-than-expected wage hike impact of 70bp, partially due to another reduction in workforce (-6.1k, down 190bp QoQ).

Despite forming a small Doji candle, the ability to stay above the previous day&rsquo;s high suggests the possibility of a bullish reversal.  Moving forward, it's crucial for the index to maintain ground above the 21-day EMA, prompting a swifter retracement and triggering short-covering. The immediate trading range for the index is estimated at 21,500 to 21,800.  Conversely, Nifty Bank experienced volatility despite a strong initial session. With mounting pressure on heavyweight HDFC Bank and upcoming results from ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, the index could face continued strain.  The robust support zone of 45,400-44,800, formed by a bullish gap, is critical, and breaching it might lead to a more significant corrective move. Currently, Bank Nifty needs to establish a foundation at the support zone while aiming for a rapid ascent above the immediate resistance at 46,100.  Here are three buy calls for next 3-4 weeks  Infosys: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,659 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,600 | Target: Rs 1,800 | Return: 8.5 percent  The stock experienced a significant breakout this week, surpassing its resistance level at Rs 1,620. The breakout was notable for its price intensity, accompanied by a substantial increase in trading volumes. Interestingly, the previous level of Rs 1,620 has now transformed into a support, highlighting a positive undertone in the trend.  Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) is above the 50 mark, indicating the presence of positive momentum in the stock.  Going ahead, we expect the prices to move higher till the mark of Rs 1,800 where the stop-loss must be Rs 1,600 on a daily closing basis.  JSW Energy: Buy | LTP: Rs 501 | Stop-Loss: Rs 485 | Target: Rs 550 | Return: 9.7 percent  The stock is presently trading at an all-time high, signaling strong momentum in its current trend. Notably, the stock has recently witnessed an upsurge in trading volumes, underscoring the enthusiasm in the trend.  Furthermore, the RSI being above the 50 mark indicates the presence of positive momentum, further affirming the strength and potential continuation of the upward trend in JSW Energy.  Going ahead, we expect the prices to move higher till the mark of Rs 485 where the stop-loss must be Rs 550 on a daily closing basis.    GAIL India: Buy | LTP: Rs 168.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 162 | Target: Rs 183.5 | Return: 9 percent  The trend in stock has gained momentum, evident from the increasing steepness in its trajectory. The recent upward movement, originating from the lower levels around Rs 132, was accompanied by notable trading volumes, indicating a substantial long buildup in prices. Additionally, the support observed during price dips by the 12-day exponential moving average (EMA) further affirms the presence of an uptrend. Going ahead, we expect the prices to move higher till the mark of Rs 183.5, where the stop-loss must be Rs 162 on a daily closing basis.

Net new deal wins also remained strong, which makes analysts hopeful of a recovery in the coming quarters","Shares of India's second largest IT services company Infosys surged nearly 6 percent in opening trade on January 12 after brokerages expect the worst for the company to be behind on the back of its strong new deal wins in Q3.  At 09.22 am, shares of Infosys were trading at Rs 1,575.10 on the NSE.  Large deal wins for Infosys remained strong at $3.2 billion in Q3, with 71 percent of them being net new deals.  Global brokerage firm Jefferies was impressed with the company's net new order book which stood at $2.2 billion. The brokerage said strong deal wins provide comfort&nbsp;to its expectations of a 13 percent EPS CAGR over&nbsp;FY24-26.

Fuelled by similar expectations of a recovery in the coming quarters, the American Depository Receipts (ADRs) of Infosys also settled 4 percent higher at $18.82 on the NYSE overnight.  The third quarter is generally a weak one for Indian IT companies due to the holiday season in the US and Europe, which are their major clients, on account of furloughs and fewer working days.  On that account, the firm reported&nbsp;a 1.7 percent sequential decline in the December profit, well below the Street's estimates. Regardless,&nbsp;Infosys managed to record a consolidated revenue of Rs 38,821 crore for the quarter, marginally above Moneycontrol's estimates of Rs 38,630 crore.

One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.  HSBC was another brokering firm that maintained its &ldquo;buy&rdquo; call on Infosys and assigned it a price target of Rs&nbsp;1,620. The brokerage said the Q3 season started with a bit of positivity for Infosys as it reported a beat on the topline, while deal wins remained decent.  The Q3 earnings of Infosys&nbsp;was the first set of decent results after back-to-back disappointments, Nuvama Institutional Equities said. &amp;quot;Deal wins, while modest, had a high share of net new (71 percent), which should boost growth for FY25 and beyond. We upgrade FY24/25/26 estimates by -0.3 percent/1.3 percent/2.2&nbsp;percent,&amp;quot; the brokerage said in its report.  The firm believes that Q3 could be the bottom for the earnings downgrade cycle for Infosys and it expects strong deal wins of the last few quarters to convert into revenue even as the US macro environment becomes favourable.  Baking that in, Nuvama raised its price target for Infosys to Rs 1,850, while retaining the &ldquo;buy&rdquo; call.  Nomura also hailed the company's good execution and strong new deal wins.

The unranked list &amp;quot;highlights business leaders who are donating from their fortunes and giving personal time and attention to their select causes&amp;quot;, Forbes said in a press release.  The annual list, which spotlights 15 philanthropists, does not include corporate philanthropy except for privately-held companies where the individual is a majority owner.  Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chairman of tech giant Infosys, have made it to the list for donating Rs 3.2 billion (USD 38 million) to his alma mater IIT Bombay in June, Forbes said, adding that the gift will be made over a period of five years.  This was to mark his 50-year association with the technology institute, where he studied electrical engineering as an undergraduate. Since 1999, Nilekani has given Rs 4 billion in total to the institute. In the past year, he donated an additional Rs 1.6 billion to educational causes.  Singh, who stepped down as chairman of DLF in 2020, in August divested his remaining direct stake in the real estate firm to fund philanthropic causes, Forbes said citing the company. He garnered Rs 7.3 billion from the disposal of his 0.59 per cent shareholding in the Delhi-based property developer.  The 92-year-old Singh, who has an estimated fortune of USD 14 billion, splits his time between London and Dubai. After previously setting up the K.P. Singh Foundation Trust and the K.P. Singh Charitable Foundation Trust, Singh launched the KP Singh Foundation in 2020.  Kamath, who made it into the Forbes' philanthropy list, joined the Giving Pledge initiative in June. In his pledge letter, the 37-year-old co-founder of discount broking firm Zerodha, wrote he is mainly interested in climate change, energy, education, and health as well as the foundation's mission to create a more equitable society.  Kamath's YouTube podcast series 'WTF is' has been giving away up to Rs 10 million (USD 120,000) -- contributed by Kamath and business leaders who are guests on his show -- to a charity picked by audience members, Forbes said. Kamath, who has an estimated net worth of USD 1.1 billion, plans to increase episode donations to Rs 40 million, it added.","Business, Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/nandan-nilekani-nikhil-kamathforbes-asia-heroesphilanthropy-list_17355031.html

In an email to select employees in entry- to mid-level roles, the company asked them to come in for that minimum number of days, starting Nov. 20. Since the pandemic, they had been allowed to work remotely full-time, and the company&rsquo;s other employees are still permitted to do so.  The internal missive, reported first in local media and verified by a company representative, followed co-founder Narayana Murthy&rsquo;s&nbsp;controversial&nbsp;comment that young Indians should work 70 hours a week. The billionaire&rsquo;s remarks, in an interview posted to YouTube, clashed with Infosys&rsquo;s official stance on complete flexibility for employees wherever possible.  India&rsquo;s IT services providers are following global tech rivals in asking workers to return, seeking to boost efficiencies as demand for their services sputters. Infosys last month trimmed its full-year sales forecast and warned it&rsquo;s suspending some hiring, suggesting the global technology spending slump has room to run.  Larger Indian rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. asked many employees to return to the office for five days a week, starting Oct. 1. In the US, Amazon.com Inc. has&nbsp;cracked down&nbsp;on employees who have ignored its request for them to come in three days a week, while Alphabet Inc.&rsquo;s Google has&nbsp;received puchback&nbsp;for its similar mandate.  On an earnings call last month, Infosys Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh said more employees are returning to offices even as the company has kept its flexible policy.  &ldquo;There are some instances, for example, with specific client work or specific type of engagement where we feel it&rsquo;s better that everyone is working together,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But in general, our view is we want to support this flexible approach. It&rsquo;s something that we believe is appropriate given how we&rsquo;ve set up the work-from-home infrastructure.&rdquo;",Business,https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/infosys-asks-some-staff-backoffice-10-daysmonth-bucking-global-trend_17294581.html

The stock saw sharp selling in New York-listed Infosys ADR shares that have fallen&nbsp;about 7 percent as of 7.30 pm (India time) to $16.25.  &ldquo;The company trimming its revenue guidance would be negative for the stock,&rdquo; said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities. &ldquo;Overall results are not so bad but discounted in prices. Revised guidance would put pressure on prices to sustain while it has maintained margins. Technically the last-minute fall in prices shows that results were not in favour of bulls, hence a gap-down opening between Rs 1,400-1,420 could be seen in the opening trade.&rdquo;  Ahead of the earnings announcement, Infosys closed at Rs 1464.55 on BSE, down about 2 percent.  Infosys narrowed its revenue growth guidance for the full year at the upper end and has now guided for revenue growth of 1-2.5 percent for the full year. This comes after it sharply slashed the guidance last quarter to 1-3.5 percent from 4-7 percent.  Sumit Pokharna, Research Analyst, Vice President at Kotak Securities, said that Infosys&rsquo; Q2 headline numbers were impressive on the back of 2.3 percent constant currency revenue growth on a sequential basis, and EBIT margin increase of 40 bps QoQ despite higher subcontracting costs and partial wage revision.  Also read:&nbsp;Infosys headcount shrinks by 7,530 in Q2, third consecutive quarter of decline  &ldquo;The company has posted good net profit numbers and a record large deal value of $7.7 billion. However, guidance cut once again at the upper end of the band implies flat to 1.9 percent decline in revenues in the next two quarters,&rdquo; said Pokharna.  The EBIT margin or the operating margin was up 40 bps to 21.2 percent, thanks to a weaker rupee and the company not rolling out wage hikes so far. The company retained its operating margin guidance of 20-22 percent.  In the ongoing quarter, the company said it will take wage hikes from November 1, which will likely put pressure on profitability.

However, in a negative surprise, the company has sharply lowered its FY24 revenue growth guidance to 1.0-3.5% YoY CC from 4.0-7.0% YoY CC earlier. It has attributed the guidance cut to lower-than-expected volume and discretionary spends, delays in decision-making and push-outs in anticipated mega deals.
