This comes four years after the Supreme Court first directed the central bank to make public a list of the country's wilful defaulters.  Among the 30 defaulters, three companies belong to fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi.  The publication said that the total outstanding advances to these 30 companies adds up to over Rs 50,000 crore. This figure also includes the amount banks have written off.  The names on the list include some well-known ones like Gitanjali Gems, Rotomac Global, Zoom Developers, Deccan Chronicle Holdings, Winsome Diamonds, REI Agro, Siddhi Vinayak Logistics and Kudos Chemie. The report states that at some point or another over the course of the past five years, the Central Bureau of Investigation or the Enforcement Directorate has filed cases against these companies or their promoters.  The list given by the RBI is sourced from the Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) which is a centralised banking database.

Small &amp;amp; midcaps could see over 20% contraction in multiples in FY19,Metis Capital Management co-founder Piyush Sharma feels the  biggest risk to equities today comes from overly optimistic expectations based on unrealistic acceleration narrative.,"Smallcaps and midcaps could see a substantial contraction in their multiples (&amp;amp;gt;20%) and largecaps could see 10-15% contraction to get valuations closer to underlying fundamentals, Piyush Sharma, Co-founder, and Co-Portfolio Manager, Metis Capital Management Ltd, said in an interview to Moneycontrol's Kshitij Anand.  Q) A straight 10% fall from the highs seen in India market after a sharp 29% rally seen in the year 2017. Do you see nervousness in the small &amp;amp;amp; midcap space which outperformed in the previous calendar year?&nbsp;&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s been a while since we had a combination of such stretched valuations coupled with peak or near-peak profitability across most industries. Bring in an element of reduction/deceleration in liquidity and you&rsquo;ll likely face sharp draw-downs as earnings expectations align with underlying realities.  It&rsquo;s hard to back a broad-based acceleration narrative at this point.&nbsp; Stocks, particularly most mid and small caps, are still well ahead of levels that can be justified by their earnings.  Q) Do you think protectionist measures initiated by the Trump government will impact Indian markets?&nbsp;  It is evident that any exporter of shrimps would be very distraught right now.&nbsp; However, the fact is that anti-dumping tariffs on shrimps, polyester fiber, steel flangs, etc. have immaterial direct or indirect impact on Nifty&rsquo;s components.  The US isn&rsquo;t a major market for Indian 2W exports either.&nbsp; The biggest potential threat one could cite would be clearly within pharmaceuticals, which make less than 5 percent of Nifty&rsquo;s weight. Overall, these actions and associated rhetoric is little more than noise.  Q) FY18 belonged to the bulls but what is your outlook for FY19?&nbsp;  While we appear to be on a solid footing in terms of overall profitability, valuations are pricing an unrealistically sharp and sustainable acceleration.&nbsp; Street expectations are for at least a high-teens earnings growth in largecaps and well ahead of 20% earnings growth in midcaps and smallcaps.  We believe that the single biggest risk to equities today comes from such overly optimistic expectations that are, in our opinion, relying on an unrealistic acceleration narrative.  Our view is that smallcaps and midcaps (as a universe) could see a substantial contraction in their multiples (&amp;amp;gt;20%) and largecaps could see&nbsp; about 10-15% contraction to get valuations closer to underlying fundamentals.  Some of that has already occurred YTD but it&rsquo;s not enough. The key driver that took small and midcap valuations to such levels was the skewed liquidity last year&nbsp;&mdash; when we disaggregated SIP allocation by capitalisation, we noted that about 45% of equity SIP allocation last year went outside largecaps even as that space collectively accounted for just 30% of total market capitalisation and even less of total free float capitalisation.  While this liquidity isn&rsquo;t large enough to drive disconnects in much more &lsquo;institutionalised&rsquo; and liquid largecaps, it disproportionately contributed towards taking small and midcap indices higher, while also artificially contributing towards the performance of supposedly &lsquo;large-cap&rsquo; domestic funds, which clearly had a very generous exposure to mid and smallcaps.  With SEBI introducing further clarity into how funds should allocate, that skewed liquidity wouldn&rsquo;t be a tailwind this year, as capital shifts towards large-caps.  While, as a universe, small and midcaps are clearly stretched, the best opportunities almost always lie within those and micro-cap parts of the size spectrum.  Here in lies the basis of our view that 2018 would be the ideal market for bottom-up managers to distinguish themselves.  At Metis, our focus is to own names where earnings expectations for our book aren&rsquo;t dependent on a wide economic turnaround to outpace broader markets in FY19, with company/industry idiosyncrasies driving above-market earnings growth.  Q) Any particular sector which is likely to hog the limelight in FY19?&nbsp;  We are bottom-up investors and we neither believe in nor recommend employing a sector-picking approach to stock selection. That said, we do believe that certain themes are likely to work better vs. others over the next few years.  In particular, we expect solid traction within scale businesses that operate within highly unorganised/informal industries (Diagnostics services, textiles, etc.).&nbsp; Impact of GST within many such industries cannot be overstated and we expect some of the names to gain significant share without compromising profitability within such fragmented industries.  Elsewhere, from a longer-term perspective, select names within consumer discretionary space look appealing, despite optically high headline multiples.  Q) After this recent correction, do you think inflows into MFs which picked up the pace in 2017 could now see some redemptions?  Less than 5 percent of the Indian MF investors arguably have staying power to tide through sharp drawdowns.&nbsp; Meanwhile, more than 3/4th of inflows aren&rsquo;t through SIPs.  Since we don&rsquo;t have any association with Indian AMCs, it&rsquo;s hard for us to speculate on their flows but numbers suggest that a sharp drawdown can easily move the flows the other way.&nbsp; In our view, these flows aren&rsquo;t as sticky as advertised.  Do you think there could be more skeletons which could come out of the closet in the banking sector especially after the Nirav Modi-PNB saga?  Skeletons typically come out when credit growth slows and therefore the denominator fails to conceal deterioration in the numerator as outstanding loans season over a period of time.  It&rsquo;s na&iuml;ve to suggest that we have seen everything. Be it a state-owned enterprise such as Air India, or a publicly-held one such as Gitanjali Gems, both PSBs, and private banks have exposures to cash-bleeding/cash-siphoning entities.  It&rsquo;s just that operational risk is much wide spread in case of PSBs and accordingly charge-offs are far higher.&nbsp; On the face of it, private banks seem much better capitalized and therefore seem unlikely to face any sort of &lsquo;disastrous&rsquo; situation at this stage.  At our end, however, given clouded visibility into the quality of credits, we have little to no exposure to Indian state-owned or private banks and we don&rsquo;t see that changing materially in the near future.  Q) FIIs seems to be bailing out from Indian markets. Do you think the trend could continue this year?&nbsp;  FPI equity flows haven&rsquo;t been particularly great over the past&nbsp;three years either, but there is limited evidence to suggest that there is any structural sudden negative shift in investor views.  However, given that a vast majority of global allocators deploy a top-down approach to EM allocations, optically high headline earnings multiples don&rsquo;t necessarily help make a case for India.  From our point of view though, we fail to see the rationale of owning say Dow 30 over Nifty 50 if you are paying essentially the same price for every dollar of earnings.&nbsp; Similarly, it&rsquo;s hard to argue against India not fundamentally deserving 30% premium over MSCI EM.","Business, Economy, markets, stocks",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/heads-up-smallmidcaps-could-see-over-20-contractionmultiplesfy19_10675581.html

But the RBI, given the nature of its role must be&nbsp; spared the innuendo.  Firstly, the Reserve Bank (RBI) is a reluctant gold regulator. It does not deal much with bullion trade.&nbsp; RBI understands the government securities and foreign exchange markets. It is itself a trader in and regulator of these markets; also it regulates banks&nbsp; which are big players in these markets. RBI is not similarly placed with respect to bullion. By&nbsp; law, it cannot trade in gold nor even buy in the secondary market. The only time RBI bought gold was in a primary market sale from the IMF in 2010. In fact, the RBI doesn&rsquo;t even have a gold department. It became the accidental implementor of the government&rsquo;s gold policies in&nbsp; the 2013&nbsp; taper tantrum crisis.  Secondly,&nbsp; when the rupee started sliding in July 2013 following the US Fed&rsquo;s decision to tighten dollar supply, India&rsquo;s biggest handicap was its massive current account deficit of 4.8&nbsp;percent in the year ended March 31, 2013. It was imperative to bring down imports and the obvious choice was to control gold imports. It is not possible for the country to come down heavily on, say crude imports or machinery imports. Also, gold imports had risen sharply in FY13 and was the single biggest reason for the unsustainable current account deficit. The fact that controlling gold imports would increase smuggling was known to one and all. RBI, under Dr Subbarao, sources tell us, was also unhappy with the 80:20 scheme, but had to acquiesce to the government&rsquo;s demand given the run on the rupee. Likewise, the next governor, Raghuram Rajan, was unconvinced of the FCNR scheme that was designed to attract dollars by offering NRIs an attractive return. But both governors agreed to the government&rsquo;s schemes because something had to be done to shore up the sagging confidence in the rupee. The ruse worked and by&nbsp; December 2013 the rupee started recovering. On the hindsight, it is possible to pick a zillion holes in both the gold control and the FCNR schemes but in the trying months of 2013 it was not possible to wait for a perfect plan.  By February 2014, as the election surveys started pointing to a victory for the BJP and chances of a stable government, the rupee strengthened. From February to May, it rose from 62 to 60 per dollar i.e. by 3.5 percent and on May 15 and 16, i.e. in just 2 days, it rose from 60 to 58&nbsp;per dollar, i.e. by a further 3.5 percent. It is possible given that appreciation, the RBI and government were worried about Indian exports getting noncompetitive. It is possible the RBI agreed to liberalization of gold imports on May 21 to smother&nbsp;the strengthening of the rupee.  The bullion traders were right in criticizing the 80:20 scheme from the start i.e. from July 2013. But few had any alternative suggestions to bring down the current account deficit. The new BJP government that took office in May 2014 also did not immediately abolish the 80:20 scheme. It waited another six months till Nov 2014. In the intervening period, according to the Congress, the then commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman had even defended the scheme in Parliament. There was a reason for the defence. Both government and RBI wanted to be sure that the current account deficit will remain manageable.  The problem with the&nbsp; BJP&rsquo;s attacks on the UPA for liberalizing the 80:20 scheme and the UPA&rsquo;s reply in attacking Nirmala Sitharaman is that on hindsight everyone forgets the psyche of policy makers in 2014, when India had just recovered from the taper tantrum and no one wanted to take chances.  Thirdly, the liberalized permission to import gold was granted to a class of importers who are identified as star or premier by the government (not RBI) based on their export record over many years. The favoured status was not granted by singling out people.  Fourthly, as data now shows, the tainted Gitanjali Gems imported the least amount of gold compared with other Star Trading Companies.  Fifthly, the Nirav Modi-Choksi team manipulated bank rules to get credit for diamonds, not gold. Even if the 80:20 scheme was a terrible one, it has no connection to the misuse of bank rules by the duo.  Sixthly, the 80:20 scheme may have had many holes, but it worked. Both gold imports and the current account deficit cam down.  There is all round criticism that the RBI should have supervised banks better. Again to be fair to RBI, it had warned banks on three occasions in 2016 and 2017 to connect the SWIFT system to their core banking systems. It had also alerted them to strictly scrutinize SWIFT messages. In the hindsight, it is clear RBI should have ensured its instructions were implemented by the banks.  That said, the RBI is the first and only line of defence when the country is in a foreign exchange crisis. It will necessarily have to take steps quickly and in real time. Such steps will benefit some and hurt others. To hurl innuendos at the central bank on hindsight, is not just unfair but also dangerous. Given the inevitable rise in interest rates globally and an incipient tariff war, there can be crises emanating from the global arena. At such times one needs the RBI to remain resolute and take quick steps to ward off these crises. It can&rsquo;t do that if there is politicized dissection on hindsight.  In the next 12 months political mud-slinging will reach a feverish pitch. But in the country&rsquo;s interest all parties, media included, must keep&nbsp; institutions like the RBI out of the slugfest.","Business, Companies, Economy, policy, Reserve Bank of India",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/comment-pnb-fraud-keep-rbi-outthe-mud-slinging_10630941.html

The total assets seized by the ED in this case are now over Rs 6,393 crore, officials had said, adding that this was being independently valued. Modi, Choksi and others are being investigated by the ED and other probe agencies after the fraud recently came to light, following a complaint by the PNB that they allegedly cheated the nationalised bank to the tune of Rs 11,400 crore, with the purported involvement of a few employees of the bank.  The CBI and the ED have registered two FIRs each to probe the case. Both Modi and Choski are said to have left the country before criminal cases were lodged against them. The ED, a central probe agency under the Union finance ministry, is investigating if the allegedly defrauded bank funds were laundered and proceeds of crime were subsequently used by the accused to create illegal assets and black money.","Business, Current Affairs, Gitanjali Gems, Market news, Punjab National Bank",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/pnb-fraud-ed-to-seek-infoover-dozen-countriesnirav-modi-choksi39s-assets_10566641.html

Undoubtedly, it would be shocking for any buyer to learn that the priced diamond bought by him or her is worth much less in reality. While women&rsquo;s love for diamonds is unlikely to wane as a result of this episode, buyers will be forced to think hard about where they want to buy their diamonds from.  For a high-value purchase like a diamond, paying a marginal premium to ensure what you're buying is authentic and trustworthy is not a big deal. So in the&nbsp;aftermath&nbsp;of the recent fraud, brands that have had a long history of being very trustworthy are&nbsp;highly likely to benefit. Here&rsquo;s why -  Product characteristics: Though it&rsquo;s fairly easy to obtain gold jewellery from informal channels, the same is not true in case of diamonds, given their expensive nature and a high degree of technicalities involved in sourcing and quality assessment.  Brand value: Customers commonly link authenticity of jewellery products with the brand name under which it is sold. The trust factor and quality reliability in this regard could encourage customers to prioritise genuine purchases from well-known names, even if they end up paying more for it.  GST transition: Post-GST, the unorganised jewellery businesses,&nbsp;which&nbsp;constitutes nearly 80 percent of the overall industry size, will lose its pricing advantage to organised counterparts. Moreover, with increasing awareness, the demand for unbranded jewellery&nbsp;may gradually decline.  Robust network: A widespread store presence pan-India, besides enabling jewellery majors to tap market share in the previously underserved/unserved geographies, would strengthen brand visibility. Additionally,&nbsp;outlets across the country may help gauge preferences better.  Better governance: The quality and competence of a company&rsquo;s management, more often than not, speaks volumes as to how effective&nbsp;the company's internal controls are. For example, Titan, run by the reputed Tata Group, is one of India&rsquo;s most trusted brands because of its emphasis on bonafide practices.  Where should you invest?  Prima facie, we expect Titan to be the key beneficiary of this shift. Apart from the positives stated above, tailwinds such as steady fundamentals, asset-light network expansion, impetus on diamond and studded jewellery, extensive marketing, and a favourable demand scenario could augur well for the company.        At 39.2x FY20 projected earnings, considering the stock&rsquo;s steep valuation, accumulation on dips is recommended.
