With merger overhangs, higher operating expenses (C/I: 40% of 3QFY24), reducing yields (owing to higher HL of HDFC Ltd) and marginally reducing ROA (~2% for 3QFY24); the bank has underperformed the whole sector. However, we believe, the negatives are in price as trailing P/BVPS (2.78x) is at comfortable level, whereas the 5-Year peak P/BVPS (5.8x) of the bank was on June &ndash; 19. The median P/BVPS for last 5 &ndash;Years was 3.8x. The trailing P/BVPS (2.8x) is way below the 5-Year median of 3.8x. Outlook We opine a turnaround from this point as the ROA is likely to stay stable despite higher operating expenses. We recommend a STRONG BUY with a TP of ₹1,762; a potential upside of 22% from current level.

This upward movement resulted in a notable gain of 1.19 percent for the week ending February 16, reflecting the strength of the bullish trend.  In previous weekly analysis, we noted the rising trend in the India VIX, which is a measure of market volatility, suggesting potential uncertainties ahead. However, despite this initial indication, the VIX formed a triple top pattern during the past week, reaching a peak of 16.57 before closing near the 15 mark. This pattern formation, coupled with the decline in the VIX by the end of the week, suggests a potential shift in sentiment towards stability or even optimism. The VIX's weekly loss of -1.46 percent further reinforces this interpretation, indicating a decrease in market volatility compared to the previous week.  In analyzing the Nifty index, despite the weekly closing falling short of the all-time high of approximately 22,126.80, there are several indicators pointing towards continued bullish momentum. One such indicator is the weekly stochastic, which has shown a bullish crossover after reversing from the 60 levels. This suggests that the buying pressure is strengthening, potentially leading to further upward movement in the market during the upcoming week. Additionally, the long/short ratio, currently fluctuating between 36-40, holds significance in determining market sentiment. A steady increase in this ratio by the next week could provide additional support for the bulls, fueling further upside movement in the Nifty index.  However, it's crucial to consider the possibility of a reversal or correction in the market. If the Nifty index were to close below the 21,800 level in the upcoming week, it may indicate a weakening of bullish sentiment and could prompt a retest of the 21,500 support level.  Bank Nifty  The banking index demonstrated resilience and strength in the past week as it rebounded once again from its 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA). This rebound was significant, leading to a weekly gain of 1.64 percent, indicating a renewed interest in buying from lower levels.  Moreover, in the previous week's analysis, a bullish BAT pattern on a daily scale was identified, hinting at the potential for upward momentum. As anticipated, the Bank Nifty indeed experienced a significant surge, pumping 1,800 points from its low to high. This reaffirms the validity and effectiveness of technical analysis in identifying potential market movements.  Looking ahead, it's crucial to monitor the Bank Nifty's performance closely. The index needs to maintain the support level of 46,000 in the upcoming week to sustain its bullish momentum. If it successfully holds above this level, there's a possibility of it testing the 47,500 level, indicating further upward movement.  However, failure to maintain support at 46,000 could result in additional selling pressure, potentially pushing the Bank Nifty down towards the next support level at 45,500.  Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,420 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,368 | Target: Rs 1,500 | Return: 5.6 percent  HDFC Bank peaked at around Rs 1,721 on December 28, 2023, before declining by approximately Rs 358 (21 percent). Over the past two weeks, the stock has traded within a tight range of Rs 1,380 to Rs 1,480, indicating market indecision.  On indicator front, the daily scale stochastics indicator identified a &amp;quot;Regular Bull Divergence&amp;quot; near a 1.13 harmonic ratio (refer to the chart). This divergence suggests potential upward momentum despite recent price declines, signalling a possible bullish reversal in the near future. Thus one can add longs in the zone of Rs 1,400-1,425 for upside target of Rs 1,500 and stop-loss would be placed near Rs 1,368 on daily close basis.    MMTC: Buy | LTP: Rs 78.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 58 | Target: Rs 110 | Return: 40 percent  Recently, MMTC has exhibited a significant technical development, notably forming an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on the monthly scale, particularly within the price range of Rs 65-75 levels. This pattern, characterised by three troughs with the middle one (head) lower than the others (shoulders), often signifies a bullish reversal.  Adding to the bullish sentiment is the observation on the indicator front. The Monthly Stochastic Oscillator, a momentum indicator, has reversed direction from the 50 level. Such a reversal is typically interpreted as a shift in momentum from bearish to bullish.  Combining these technical signals, we've recommended traders to initiate long positions in MMTC within the range of Rs 70-80, with a bullish target set at Rs 110. To manage risk, we've suggested implementing a stop-loss strategy, with the stop-loss set at Rs 58 on a daily closing basis.    Rain Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 201 | Stop-Loss: Rs 175 | Target: Rs 240 | Return: 19 percent  From March 2023 till December 2023, the said counter has been consolidating between Rs 145 and Rs 155. Since last 2 months, it has given a breakout from the said range on a weekly closing basis, which is looking lucrative.  Having said that, it has also formed a bullish GARTLEY pattern, which is 1.38 years old, thus making it more reliable. Also, it has violated a couple of trendlines (refer to the chart). The best part about this bullish reversal is that every bottom has bought with huge volume bars (refer to the chart), which indicates bullish bias in the counter.  On the indicator front, the monthly stochastic shying away from being oversold, which further affirms our bullish stance on the counter. Thus, we advised traders and investors to go long in the range of Rs 190-205 with an upside target of Rs 240, and the stop-loss would be placed at Rs 175 on a daily close basis.  Note: The Gartley pattern is a harmonic chart pattern, based on Fibonacci numbers and ratios, that helps traders identify reaction highs and lows.

While this is sentimentally positive for the six stocks in the near term, it does&nbsp;not mean that&nbsp;HDFC's stake will necessarily go up to 9.5 percent in these lenders .  We spoke to analysts and looked into past trends of such RBI approvals.&nbsp;Here is what we found:  What is the RBI approval all about?  The HDFC&nbsp;group as a whole, including HDFC Life, HDFC AMC and HDFC Ergo, can now acquire up to 9.5 percent stake each in&nbsp;six banks -&nbsp;IndusInd Bank,&nbsp;Yes Bank,&nbsp;Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Suryoday Small Finance Bank and Bandhan Bank.  A business group cannot hold more than 10 percent stake in a bank. Therefore, approvals are sought for 9.99 percent, the maximum limit.  Despite the perceived intent, it does not mean that&nbsp;full&nbsp;9.99 percent stake will be acquired. Since it does not make sense to seek RBI approval for every 1-2 percent stake, companies tend to ask for the maximum 9.99 percent.  How much does the HDFC group currently hold in these banks?  At the end of the December quarter, it held 3.43 percent in ICICI Bank, 2.57 percent in Axis Bank, 4.48 percent in IndusInd Bank and 3 percent in Yes Bank.  Why is RBI approval needed?  The RBI's approval is a must for anyone looking to acquire more than 5 percent stake in a bank as it is a highly regulated sector, said&nbsp;Vijay Singh Gour, lead analyst, Choice Broking.  Also Read:&nbsp;China's market restrictions won't help, may be bad for EMs, no immediate impact on India  What is the validity of the approval?  The approval is valid for a year and if HDFC fails to acquire the shareholding within that period, the approval stands cancelled.  If the holding stands at&nbsp;sub-5 percent before the year-end, then RBI&rsquo;s approval will be required again to increase it to 5 percent or more.  Is this sign of merger?  No. It is simply an approval for investment purpose, clarified Jignesh Shial of Incred Equities.  Other examples...  LIC on January 24 received the RBI's approval to acquire up to 9.99 percent in HDFC Bank. In December 2023, ICICI Prudential AMC got RBI nod to&nbsp;acquire 9.99 percent in Federal Bank.  In October 2023,&nbsp;HDFC AMC&nbsp;got the RBI&rsquo;s go-ahead to acquire&nbsp;9.5 percent in DCB Bank, Equitas Small Finance Bank, The Federal Bank, Karur Vysya Bank and City Union Bank.  Also Read:&nbsp;Credit growth to moderate to 13%; Paytm and lower-rated NBFCs at risk: Macquarie&rsquo;s Suresh Ganapathy  Any instances where RBI approval has lapsed&nbsp;before a 9.9 percent stake acquisition?  Yes. In November 2021, LIC&nbsp;got approval to hike stake in Kotak&nbsp;Mahindra Bank to up to 9.9 percent. A year later, its stake in the lender had gone up to 6.25 percent from 4.96 percent.  In May 2023, SBI MF received similar approval&nbsp;for HDFC Bank. Three months to go for the validity to lapse and SBI MF holds about 5.57 percent stake in the bank.  What does it mean for the six stocks?  It is a sentimentally positive news, said Nitin Aggarwal, head&ndash;BFSI research, institutional equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.&nbsp;&ldquo;Flows should come in over the medium term,&amp;quot; he said.  What do back-to-back RBI approvals indicate?  Domestic institutions, including LIC, are eyeing to increase stake in&nbsp;private banks. Since October 2023,&nbsp;domestic institutions have created over Rs 1.4 lakh crore headroom to&nbsp;buy stakes.  With the general election unlikely to throw a surprise and expectations of private capex picking up, domestic institutions are waiting on the sidelines to hike stakes in banks and financials.  Banking stocks are seen as a reasonably valued bets at a time when the market sits on high valuations, analysts said.","Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank, Buzzing Stocks, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/buzzing-stocks/mc-explains-|-will-hdfc-group-go-aheadacquire-95-stakeall6-banks_17431451.html

Not really, say analysts","On January 29, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) single-handedly contributed to a 38 percent surge in the Nifty 50 market capitalisation.  ","A 6 percent rally in Reliance Industries on January 29 does not really indicate a comeback for largecap stocks, analysts told Moneycontrol. Money is simply flowing from one largecap to another as foreign investors are recasting their portfolios, they argued.  On January 29, Mukesh Ambani-led&nbsp;Reliance Industries (RIL) alone contributed to a 38 percent surge in the Nifty 50 market capitalisation, while&nbsp;ONGC,&nbsp;Adani Enterprises, Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro, HDFC Bank and Coal India together contributed over 26 percent to the rally.  &amp;quot;Reliance benefits from three things: Zee-Sony merger fallout, refining margins shaping well, and new energy vertical scaling up. It is a very stock-specific move,&amp;quot; said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Direct.  Also Read:&nbsp;RIL rally triggered by funds taking refuge in &lsquo;strong stock&rsquo; to hedge against short positions  &amp;quot;I don't think the Reliance move indicates a trend reversal for largecaps, though largecaps are a lot more attractive than midcaps from a risk-reward perspective. Till the results season pans out, it will be a lot of stock-specific moves, I believe,&amp;quot; Pandey said.  RIL strong, other heavyweights weak  The sheer weight of Reliance Industries on the Nifty 50, which was 9.2 percent as of end-December, means that any further rally in the stock should propel the&nbsp;benchmark index&nbsp;further, in theory. But, other heavyweights like HDFC Bank and&nbsp;TCS are not showing enough strength for the index to move forward decisively, said analysts.  HDFC Bank is down 14 percent in the past one month while TCS is&nbsp;up barely 0.16 percent.&nbsp;As of December-end, HDFC Bank had 13.52 percent weightage on the index, TCS had 4.5 percent.  HDFC Bank&nbsp;shares have seen a sharp sell-off after its Q3 FY24 results.&nbsp;The bank reported a key miss in net interest margins (NIM) due to the low deposit growth and higher cost of funds. Higher provisions and decadal low earnings per share (EPS) growth in Q3 are also contributing to the decline in shares.  All IT companies, including TCS&nbsp;and Infosys, continued to post&nbsp;soft numbers in Q3.  Also Read:&nbsp;HDFC Bank faces tough task to deliver both on margins and costs: Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie  On the other hand, the recent surge in Singapore GRMs (gross refining margins) indicates a positive outlook for RIL's oil-to-chemicals business, said independent analyst Prakash Diwan.  This marks a valuation reset for RIL, which is currently under-owned by FIIs, he said. &amp;quot;As FIIs sell HDFC Bank, IT and FMCG stocks due to bleak outlook, they will redirect funds elsewhere. And, RIL will be a big beneficiary. FIIs can move out of some stocks but cannot move out of Indian markets as a whole, so money is now going to RIL,&amp;quot; Diwan added.  Where is Nifty headed next?  With the Interim Budget just a couple of months away, the Q3 results season still playing out, and valuations slightly out of the comfort zone, the Nifty 50 is expected to remain rangebound.  Going ahead, similar erratic movements may persist ahead of key events, said analysts at Angel One. Immediate resistance for the Nifty is apparent around the 21,850 - 21,950 zone, while immediate support has shifted higher towards the 21,600-21,550 zone.

The 48-year-old even took out a loan to buy more of the notes to get a better return on his investment.  But by March last year, just 18 months after he bought the bonds, Sinha had lost most of his investment. The majority of the notes turned out to be Credit Suisse&rsquo;s Additional Tier 1 bonds, also known as contingent convertibles or CoCos. Global bondholders were wiped out when Switzerland&rsquo;s regulator wrote down about&nbsp;$17 billion&nbsp;of the notes during the bank&rsquo;s rescue by UBS Group AG.  For Sinha, the financial losses may not have ended. HDFC has put a lien on one of his term deposits to pay back part of the loan.  &ldquo;While I run companies, I&rsquo;m a very poor personal investor,&rdquo; said Sinha, who is originally from India but now lives in Sri Lanka, where he is the managing director of a global beverage company. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in danger of losing all my liquidity and savings I had for my children&rsquo;s education.&rdquo;  Sinha&rsquo;s situation highlights how individual investors continue to experience financial pain from the historic wipe out of Credit Suisse&rsquo;s AT1 bonds. It&rsquo;s also a warning for people investing in riskier instruments without fully understanding them &mdash; an issue around the world and pertinent in India, where rising personal wealth has increased people&rsquo;s appetite for higher yielding investments.  Fighting Back  AT1 bonds were developed after the global financial crisis to shift the burden of bank rescues onto bondholders and away from taxpayers. They&rsquo;re the lowest rung of debt, producing juicy returns in good times but taking a hit if the bank runs into trouble.  In India, banks are prohibited from selling the notes to retail investors, but there are exceptions for &ldquo;professional investors&rdquo; &mdash; a person who is financially well-informed and has more than $1 million to invest. And while HDFC couldn&rsquo;t sell the Credit Suisse bonds to Indian residents, it could legally sell them to its overseas customers who met the professional investor criteria.  Sinha alleges HDFC and his relationship managers at the bank mis-sold the bonds&nbsp;by saying they were secure and failing to explain the risks. He alleges the bank didn&rsquo;t help him exit his position despite the concerns he says he expressed about the falling value, and that he was advised to take out the loan. He also claims he was incorrectly classified as a professional investor, with a net worth of more than $4 million.  Sinha has filed a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in India about HDFC and is seeking $3 million in compensation. The first hearing on his complaint, initially scheduled for Jan. 16, has been adjourned until March. The commission, which has decided the case merits a hearing, has the power to summon HDFC to respond to Sinha&rsquo;s allegations and can award damages if it deems it to be appropriate.  HDFC, in response to questions from Bloomberg News, said all processes were followed and laws complied with when it executed transactions for bonds arranged through offshore branches, including those of&nbsp;Credit Suisse.  The bank said the bonds were &ldquo;reversed solicited,&rdquo; meaning the customer requested them, and that the clients were assessed as professional.  &ldquo;HDFC Bank would like to make it clear that it takes extreme care while arranging third party financial instruments, as per specific client requests and fulfills all local regulations,&rdquo; a spokesperson for the bank said in a written statement.  Sinha isn&rsquo;t alone in expressing concerns about HDFC&rsquo;s disclosures and vetting process for AT1 bonds. UAE-based Varun Mahajan, also a non-resident Indian, alleges he and his wife weren&rsquo;t briefed on the risks of the Credit Suisse CoCos and says they lost $279,775. The couple continues to make interest payments on the loan advanced by HDFC to add leverage to the bonds. They haven&rsquo;t filed claims with the commission or any other agency.  &ldquo;The bank did not disclose to me that the Credit Suisse bonds were AT1 bonds, or the risks associated with them &mdash; they offered these AT1 bonds in the same document as non-AT1 bonds,&rdquo; Mahajan told Bloomberg. &ldquo;The bank didn&rsquo;t do its diligence to ascertain we were eligible. We are not qualified investors but retail ones.&rdquo;  An Afghanistan country manager for a multilateral organization also alleges he was mis-sold the bonds in which he invested $100,000 of his savings and took a loan of $179,000 from HDFC. The man, who asked not to be named because the matter is sensitive, says his relationship manager kept insisting there was no default risk in the bonds and he would get the par value back at maturity. He has also not filed a claim with the commission.  HDFC said in all cases, leverage was provided at the request of the clients, proper disclosures were made and consent obtained.  &ldquo;A few complaints, received, have been properly addressed, as per the bank&rsquo;s process and all documentation shared with clients,&rdquo; the HDFC spokesperson said.  Losses from Credit Suisse&rsquo;s AT1s have resulted in several lawsuits, including in Japan where investors have&nbsp;been active&nbsp;in holding financial firms to account. They have sued some major Japanese brokerages alleging the firms sold the notes while offering incorrect explanations about them. Another group of Japanese investors sued Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.&rsquo;s joint brokerage venture with Morgan Stanley. Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities disputes the&nbsp;accusations, Nikkei Asia reported on Jan. 15.  &ldquo;Being a qualified investor means you have to read the fine print and not invest in something you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Delhi-based entrepreneur Rohit Anand, whose savings got stuck in investments he made at the behest of his prior bankers. &ldquo; I don&rsquo;t put all my eggs in one basket anymore.&rdquo;","Business, Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/credit-suisse-at1-bond-fallout-hits-indiaâs-most-valuable-bank_17419551.html

RBI allowed LIC to buy up to a 9.99 percent stake in the private sector lender from its current hold of 5.2 percent. This will be sentimentally positive for the stock and any downside from here on would be limited, said analysts.  &amp;quot;We expect HDFC Bank stock to recover current losses and jump back by 15 percent in the next one year,&amp;quot; said Chokkalingam G, Founder at Equinomics Research. He said that the bank is increasing its focus on rural and semi-urban areas and this will prove to be the next growth levers.  Shares of HDFC Bank tumbled 14 percent after the lender's Q3 financials came below Street estimates. Factors like fall in earnings per share (EPS), margin strain and sluggish deposit growth contributed to the negative sentiment around the stock. As a result, Bank Nifty, wherein it carries a 40 percent weightage also declined by over a percent.  ALSO READ:&nbsp;HDFC Bank stock gains 2% after LIC gets RBI nod to buy 4.8% additional stake  LIC's additional stake buyout in HDFC Bank is a 'value-buy', say&nbsp;experts  Market experts believe that LIC's proposed additional stake buyout of 4.8 percent comes at a time when the lender's stock valuation turned attractive post its steep fall. They believe that the buyout would be gradual in process, spread over a one-year time frame and not an immediate one-time acquisition.  &amp;quot;LIC will start buying its approved additional stake in HDFC Bank in a slow manner. Since HDFC Bank's valuations have turned attractive from historical averages, it is most likely expected that LIC will complete the rest of its acquisition,&amp;quot; said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.  Currently, HDFC Bank stock trades at 2.4-2.5 times (x) price-to-book (PB) value as against historical averages of 4xPB value, said analysts.  The RBI has advised LIC to complete its approved shareholding in HDFC Bank within a period of one year, that is by January 24, 2025. LIC&rsquo;s current stake at HDFC Bank is valued at nearly Rs 50,000 crore. So another round of Rs 50,000 crore fresh buyout will be done gradually, added Chokkalingam G of Equinomics Research.  Kaitav Shah, lead BFSI analyst at Anand Rathi Institutional Equities sees LIC's additional stake approval in HDFC Bank as a 'value buy.' He believes that LIC's support will bode well for the stock that saw merger challenges this quarter.  &amp;quot;Though we expect merger pangs to persist for the next couple of quarters, the bank may come out as winner once it balances its margin and growth pain. We will take another year to assess the bank's profitability due to its recent merger, hence, sharing a 'hold' call,&amp;quot; he told CNBC-TV18.  ALSO READ:&nbsp;Daily Voice | This market strategist says downside risk to HDFC Bank limited  LIC's shareholding in HDFC Bank vs other private peers  Historically, LIC has been increasing its stake in HDFC Bank over the last few quarters. The insurance giant grew its stake to 5.19 percent in December 2023 from 4.12 percent in December 2022. (see chart)    Apart from HDFC Bank, LIC also has stake in other private peers like ICICI Bank (6.9 percent), Kotak Mahindra Bank (6.2 percent), and Axis Bank (8.2 percent), showed data.

The stock has crashed 14 percent after the private sector lender reported its December quarter results. Margin strain, fall in earnings per share (EPS) and slower-than-expected deposit growth have hit the sentiment.  The RBI allowed LIC to acquire the shareholding by January 24, 2025, the bank said in an exchange filing. LIC must also ensure that its aggregate holding does not exceed 9.99 percent of the&nbsp;paid-up share capital or voting rights of the&nbsp;bank.  ALSO READ:&nbsp;RBI allows LIC to acquire up to 9.99% stake in HDFC Bank  In the third quarter, HDFC Bank's net interest income (NII) grew 4 percent on-quarter, led by a 4.9 percent sequential growth in gross advances, while its net profit was up 2.5 percent on-quarter supported by bulky treasury gains and favourable tax write-backs of Rs 1,500 crore.  Higher cost of funds, or borrowing costs, however, limited expansion in net interest margins (NIMs) for the banking giant, keeping them flat sequentially at 3.6 percent in Q3FY24.  Analysts at&nbsp;HSBC have a &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; call on the lender but reduced the target price to Rs 1,950 from Rs 2,080, saying they see few levers for NIM expansion.  &amp;quot;We moderate NIM expansion to 15 bps (basis points) over FY24-26 versus 30 bps earlier.

Furthermore, the contingent stands adequate. In 2QFY24, the provisioning expenses were higher sequentially at ₹42.2bn (v/s ₹29.1bn 2QFY24).

After sharp fall in 2Q, Bank noted stable NIM at 3.6% (3.4% on assets), which we believe was partly due to absence of the ICRR drag and a better LDR. Though deposit growth was slower in 3Q (+2% QoQ), Bank contends that it would continue to resist bulk deposits unlike other banks, and even mobilize regulatory cost-efficient borrowings in the interim. That said, we believe the Bank needs to accelerate deposit growth, given rising regulatory concerns about higher LDR (+100%) and lower LCR at 110%. This may have some bearing on margins in the near term, but would support structural margin recovery in the long run, as it replaces the high-cost eHDFCL borrowings and thus supports core profitability. On asset quality, Bank remains comfortably placed, while one off-gains from the HDFC Credila stake sale, potentially in 4Q, could help it further shore-up provision buffers.  Outlook We cut FY25-26E earnings by 3%, building-in the growth moderation, but retain our long term BUY with TP of Rs2,100/sh (valuing the core bank at 2.8x Dec-25E ABV + subs at Rs192/sh).

With system liquidity in shortfall and peak LDR at 77.4%, deposit growth should be faster for current loan momentum to sustain, failing which system loan accretion should reduce in FY25/26E, compressing LDRs. Factoring a 15% CAGR for HDFCB, we trim loan growth by 1% in FY25/26E which would impact NIM by 4/5bps. This could be partly offset by lower opex given softer deposit requirement; our core PAT reduces by 2%/4%.

Domestic markets were still under pressure, especially because of poor numbers from a few major players. The Nifty index had a high near 21,750 before closing near 21,200 with a decent loss for the second consecutive week.  During past sessions, the benchmark index Nifty found support at 21,150, which then led to a massive rise from there. Interestingly, the index has reversed from the support of a bullish Wolfe Wave formation. Based on the pattern, the index may revisit the 21,700&ndash;21,800 zone in the upcoming week if the recent low near 21,150 is not broken. In the worst-case scenario, we anticipate that the index will take support below 21,150, close to the 20,900 zone, where multiple supports are placed and the AB=CD pattern is completed.  The 200 DEMA (day exponential moving average 44,570) of the Nifty Bank index has been retested, and we anticipate that this zone will serve as support in the upcoming sessions. Overall, we anticipate a strong rebound in the Nifty Bank index during the February 2024 derivative series if the 45,000&ndash;44,000 support holds.  Here are three buy calls for short term:  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,435 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,380 | Target: Rs 1,550 | Return: 8 percent  Since the last 2 years or so, the said counter has been rejected six times from Rs 1,725&ndash;1,750 zone and is currently placed near Rs 1,430 mark. Currently, HDFC Bank has taken timely support near the October 2022 low of around Rs 1,380. Coincidentally, it is 200 DEMA, thus making it a viable buy at the current juncture.  The fall from January 17, 2024, to January 23, 2024, has witnessed decreasing volume (refer to the chart), which hints that bears are losing steam. On January 24, 2024, HDFC Bank made a classic Bullish Piercing candlestick pattern accompanied by decent volume, which cannot be ignored as of now.  Also, in the hourly time frame, it has managed to generate Bull divergence on stochastic. Based on the technical setup, one can accumulate the said counter in the range of Rs 1,420&ndash;1,450 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,380 and a target of Rs 1,550.    Rain Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 175.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 155 | Target: Rs 210 | Return: 20 percent  Since the last 2 months or so, the said counter has been consolidating between Rs 145 and Rs 155. Recently, it has given a breakout from the said range on a weekly closing basis, which is looking lucrative. Having said that, it has also formed a bullish GARTLEY pattern, which is 1.38 years old, thus making it more reliable.  Also, it has violated a couple of trendlines. The best part about this bullish reversal is that every bottom has bought with huge volume bars, which indicates bullish bias in the counter.  On the indicator front, the weekly RSI (relative strength index) has given a trendline violation, which further affirms our bullish stance on the counter. Thus, we advised traders and investors to go long in the range of Rs 170-176 with an upside target of Rs 210, and the stop-loss would be placed at Rs 155 on a daily close basis.  Note: The Gartley pattern is a Harmonic chart pattern, based on Fibonacci numbers and ratios, which help traders, identify reaction highs and lows.    Greaves Cotton: Buy | LTP: Rs 165 | Stop-Loss: Rs 143 | Target: Rs 200 | Return: 21 percent  The entire 2023 year went by, consolidating around 100&ndash;200 DEMA (exponential moving average), followed by recent bear trendline violations (refer to the chart). Also, volume is picking up from lower levels, thus making it attractive at current levels.  On the indicator front, the weekly MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has given a bull cross just near the zero line, which further affirms our bullish stance. Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 163&ndash;166 with a target of Rs 200 and a stop-loss of Rs 143 on a daily basis.

Sun Pharma made a fresh record high in the previous session. The stock continued to rise despite of broader markets falling.  On the below chart, we can see prices have broken above the upward sloping channel and shown strong positive momentum.

We can see most of the lows are formed on our cycle and after almost every 53 period, HDFC Bank has shown a positive reversal. Currently, Time cycle of 53 days is due by January 25. So, post January 25, we can expect some buying.  However, price action is a must to confirm the same and for that we need a close above Rs 1,475 levels. A close above it can suggest that short term bottom has formed.  In short, trend for this stock is still negative. Any break below Rs 1,400 can drag the price lower towards Rs 1,340 levels. Whereas a close above Rs 1,475 can result into a short covering which can lift the price higher towards Rs 1,520-1,530 levels.
