This, along with weak discretionary demand and cross-currency tailwinds in Q3 FY24, is expected to keep net profit muted. The company is scheduled to announce October-December results on January 12, 2024.  According to an average estimate of five brokerages, revenue is expected to decline 4 percent QoQ to Rs 22,408 crore. This would be worse than the far end of the management guidance band of -1.5 percent to -3.5 percent revenue growth in the quarter. On the other hand, Wipro's net profit is likely to see a drastic fall of 9 percent QoQ to Rs 2,756 crore.

The firm&rsquo;s EBITDA is expected to remain flat at Rs 4,245 crore in Q3 FY24, compared to Rs 4,231 crore in Q2 FY24, said analysts at Axis Capital.  Further, wage hikes are likely to hit Wipro's earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins by 30 basis points (bps) on a QoQ basis to 16 percent in Q3 FY24 compared to 16.3 percent in Q2 FY24, as per an average of five brokerage estimates.

Meanwhile, some of the key monitorables for investors are Wipro's outlook for client IT spend in key verticals like financial services, along with geographies in Europe, TCV bookings and the likely path to translation of bookings to revenue growth, and any impact from senior-level exits in recent months, said analysts.

It has already completed its 20-month price wise as well as time wise correction phase, Sameet Chavan says.","&amp;quot;If we have to take a view for a few months, it&rsquo;s evident that the Bank Nifty will cross the 50,000 milestone, but it&rsquo;s hard to predict if it would be reached in January itself after such a steep rally in a short span,&amp;quot; Sameet Chavan, vice-president for technical and derivatives at Angel One, says in an interview to Moneycontrol.  So, with the present trend, it should not be a surprise to see the Nifty FMCG heading towards 58,000 - 59,000 in the coming week, but if it has to reach the milestone of 60,000 and beyond, the heavyweight counter ITC needs to chip in, he says.  With more than 16 years of experience in the stock market, Chavan believes that irrespective of the benchmark index&rsquo;s move, the IT space is likely to outperform in the near term. &amp;quot;We expect the IT index to reach 37,000-38,000 soon and even challenge its previous highs of 39,500.&amp;quot;&nbsp;Let's take a look at the conversation he had...  Do you expect the momentum to take the Nifty 50 beyond 22,000-23,000 in January series, though currently it looks overbought?  In such kind of strong rally, it&rsquo;s pretty difficult to judge where this momentum will start. But going by the observations, although it&rsquo;s favouring the bulls, the caution is warranted due to elevated levels, indicated by overbought indicators and prices deviating significantly from key moving averages.  Hence, upcoming sessions would be crucial, with the market now focusing on the pre-Budget move (interim budget) after recent positive developments. Hence, rather than being vocal on any levels, it&rsquo;s advisable to stay focused on how market behave in the first half of January.  Also read:&nbsp;Despite 20% rally in 2023, this CIO won't call it a very overvalued market, advises to focus on these 4 sectors  Do you expect the Bank Nifty to surpass 50,000 in the January series?  The commentary remains same for this high beta index as well. If we have to take a view for few months, it&rsquo;s evident that Bank Nifty will cross the milestone of 50,000; but it&rsquo;s hard to pre-empt meeting it in January after such a steep rally in a short span.  Are the charts telling you that the Nifty FMCG index is marching towards 60,000 in the next couple of months?  Top five constituents in Nifty FMCG are ITC, Hindustan Unilever, Nestle, Britannia Industries and Tata Consumer Products, which hold a weightage of nearly 73 percent. Barring ITC, all others are in a strong momentum at this juncture, indicating possibility of this index extending its gains in the coming series as well.  Also read:&nbsp;Demand uptick, easing inflation in developed markets to provide silver lining for exports in 2024  So, with the ongoing trend, we will not be surprised to see the Nifty FMCG index heading towards 58,000 - 59,000 in the coming week. But if it has to reach the milestone of 60,000 and beyond, the heavyweight counter ITC needs to chip in. It has a weightage of nearly 31 percent and hence, will provide the much-needed impetus to reach new heights.  Your top 2 picks for January that has seen strong breakout signal recently?  The entire IT space finally found its mojo after a long slumber phase. Most of the frontline as well as midcap counters have already moved a quite bit in recent months. But now it&rsquo;s time for &lsquo;Wipro&rsquo; to outshine. The stock has already confirmed its multi-month breakout last week. We expect price targets of Rs 498-510 in the coming series. One can look to buy on a decline with stop-loss around Rs 448.  From the broader market, we like KRBL as it has started to show early signs of revival. Prices have confirmed a price volume breakout on Friday, we like it for a target of Rs 398 and stop-loss at Rs 362.  Do you think the Nifty IT has seen consolidation before entering into another leg of upward journey towards 37,000-38,000 levels in coming weeks?  In our sense, irrespective of benchmark index&rsquo;s move, the IT space is likely to outperform in the near term. It has already completed its 20-month price wise as well as time wise correction phase.  Hence, in case of any minor consolidation or smaller declines, it would offer excellent buying opportunity to buy into this pocket. Soon, we expect the IT index reach 37,000-38,000 levels and even challenging its previous highs around 39,500 cannot be rule out.  Also read:&nbsp;What the new year holds for Indian markets?  Will the major downward move be looking unlikely in Nifty Auto index in 2024 after looking at the chart structure?  Auto has been one of the few sectors who initiated this Bull Run last year. Since then, there has been no stopping for this for this space. In fact, Auto sector is considered as a barometer of country&rsquo;s economy, demonstrates the robust growth.  Despite this being in a strong momentum, one should avoid being complacent at current levels. Technically, the daily chart exhibits a &lsquo;Negative Divergence&rsquo; in &lsquo;RSI-Smoothened&rsquo; oscillator. Hence, any time we could see some breather in this rank outperformer before unfolding the next leg of the rally.  Do you see major breakout in Hindustan Unilever soon after reading its charts?  Overall, this stock has done nothing since last couple of years; but now we are seeing some early signs of revival. On the smaller time frame charts, prices are gaining strength day-by-day and importantly, it has managed to surpass its intermediate hurdle of Rs 2,640 on a closing basis. With FMCG index trading at record highs, this stock needs to catch up now and there is high possibility that we would see this stock breaking the shackles in coming days.

Unlike the surge of over 16 percent seen in 2003, this time, the month ended with a gain of approximately 8 percent. The year as a whole proved to be exceptional for the domestic market, despite various geopolitical challenges.  The benchmark indices experienced a remarkable growth of around 20 percent throughout the year, making it the eighth straight year of positive performance. During this period, the Nifty index reached a significant milestone of 21,800. In the final week of October 2023, we confidently predicted a bottom when the Nifty index was approaching the 19,000 mark. This prediction was based on the long-short ratio of FII index futures, which had reached nearly 10 percent. Since then, the index has rallied by approximately 3,000 points without any significant dips.  There are no signs of exhaustion on the price chart or momentum oscillators, except for a negative divergence in the daily RSI (relative strength index). However, the long-short ratio of FII's index future is now hovering around 70 percent. In the past 2-3 years, whenever this ratio has reached the range of 70-75 percent, we have observed a temporary top in the markets. This suggests that there may still be some room for further upside in the Nifty, but it could potentially be the final phase of the rally, followed by heavy profit-booking.  In terms of levels, the next psychological hurdle for the Nifty could be at 22,000, followed by 22,400. These levels could indicate the beginning of a corrective move. Traders are advised to maintain a cautious approach with regards to long positions.  For individual stock opportunities, it is crucial to adhere to strict stop losses, especially for small and midcap stocks. On the downside, immediate support is expected at 21,400, while 21,000 is considered a crucial support level.  Despite the Nifty Bank index's impressive performance in December 2023, surpassing the benchmark indices with a surge of over 8.5 percent, the overall performance of the index in the year 2023 was not as remarkable. Throughout the year, the index only gained over 12 percent, suggesting a significant underperformance.  However, there is currently a new breakout in the index, indicating the potential for further growth towards the milestone of 50,000. It is important to note that the index's support level is now at 47,500, and if it closes below this level, it may impede any further upward movement in the index.  Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  Wipro: Buy | LTP: Rs 471.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 440 | Target: Rs 530 | Return: 12.5 percent  Wipro has made a solid base near Rs 400&ndash;420 levels. Interestingly, time retracement is 0.886 approximately, along with price retracement of 0.618 percent approximately on the monthly time frame.  Additionally, it is sustaining above all major exponential moving averages. Moreover, monthly stochastics has reversed from 50 levels, which is looking lucrative. Thus, we advise traders to go long in the stock in the range of Rs 465&ndash;475 with a stop-loss of Rs 440 for the upside target of Rs 530.  Note: refer to the chart for details on time and price retracement calculation    Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals: Buy | LTP: Rs 310.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 285 | Target: Rs 355 | Return: 14 percent  For the past week or so, the counter has gained momentum. From a retracement perspective, alternate wave retracement comes exactly near 0.618 and 1.628 of its previous up moves, thus making it a lucrative buy. Having said that, time and price retracement are falling at the same length, which is a strong indication of bottoming out. (Time retracement is 0.886 and price retracement is 0.786 percent).  On the indicator front, the weekly RSI (relative strength index) has reversed from 50 levels, which further confirms our bullish stance on the counter. Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 305&ndash;312 for a target of Rs 355 and a stop-loss of Rs 285 on a daily closing basis.  Note: refer to the chart for details on time and price retracement calculation    Clean Science and Technology: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,549.1 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,450 | Target: Rs 1,700 | Return: 10 percent  Clean had been consolidating between Rs 1,330 and Rs 1,430. Recently, it broke out from said levels and sustained above them. Also, the bear trendline on a weekly scale has been violated, along with stochastic has given bull divergence, which is looking lucrative.  Thus, we advised traders to go long in the zone of Rs 1,525-1,550 with a stop loss of Rs 1,450 and an upside target of Rs 1,700.

Despite healthy deal wins, the softness is expected to continue in 2Q, as the company has guided for revenue performance of -2% to +1% CC in 2QFY24. Given WPRO&rsquo;s boarder presence in the discretionary areas, the conversion is a challenge as enterprises are cautious and are reprioritizing spends. EBIT margin (IT Services) was down 30bp QoQ at 16.0%, in line with our estimate. Amid macro uncertainties, the management is confident of maintaining the margin in 2Q by deferring the wage hike cycle to 3Q.

The selective pockets &ndash; BFS, Hi-Tech, Retail and Consumer &ndash; are exhibiting signs of caution in their technology spends due to lingering inflation and weak consumer spending. Conversely, demand in Telecom appears positive, where clients are reprioritizing spends to monetize their 5G investments. Additionally, Healthcare, Utilities and Automotive are showing strong resilience amid the adverse macro situation.
