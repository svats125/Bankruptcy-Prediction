Not really, say analysts","On January 29, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) single-handedly contributed to a 38 percent surge in the Nifty 50 market capitalisation.  ","A 6 percent rally in Reliance Industries on January 29 does not really indicate a comeback for largecap stocks, analysts told Moneycontrol. Money is simply flowing from one largecap to another as foreign investors are recasting their portfolios, they argued.  On January 29, Mukesh Ambani-led&nbsp;Reliance Industries (RIL) alone contributed to a 38 percent surge in the Nifty 50 market capitalisation, while&nbsp;ONGC,&nbsp;Adani Enterprises, Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro, HDFC Bank and Coal India together contributed over 26 percent to the rally.  &amp;quot;Reliance benefits from three things: Zee-Sony merger fallout, refining margins shaping well, and new energy vertical scaling up. It is a very stock-specific move,&amp;quot; said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Direct.  Also Read:&nbsp;RIL rally triggered by funds taking refuge in &lsquo;strong stock&rsquo; to hedge against short positions  &amp;quot;I don't think the Reliance move indicates a trend reversal for largecaps, though largecaps are a lot more attractive than midcaps from a risk-reward perspective. Till the results season pans out, it will be a lot of stock-specific moves, I believe,&amp;quot; Pandey said.  RIL strong, other heavyweights weak  The sheer weight of Reliance Industries on the Nifty 50, which was 9.2 percent as of end-December, means that any further rally in the stock should propel the&nbsp;benchmark index&nbsp;further, in theory. But, other heavyweights like HDFC Bank and&nbsp;TCS are not showing enough strength for the index to move forward decisively, said analysts.  HDFC Bank is down 14 percent in the past one month while TCS is&nbsp;up barely 0.16 percent.&nbsp;As of December-end, HDFC Bank had 13.52 percent weightage on the index, TCS had 4.5 percent.  HDFC Bank&nbsp;shares have seen a sharp sell-off after its Q3 FY24 results.&nbsp;The bank reported a key miss in net interest margins (NIM) due to the low deposit growth and higher cost of funds. Higher provisions and decadal low earnings per share (EPS) growth in Q3 are also contributing to the decline in shares.  All IT companies, including TCS&nbsp;and Infosys, continued to post&nbsp;soft numbers in Q3.  Also Read:&nbsp;HDFC Bank faces tough task to deliver both on margins and costs: Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie  On the other hand, the recent surge in Singapore GRMs (gross refining margins) indicates a positive outlook for RIL's oil-to-chemicals business, said independent analyst Prakash Diwan.  This marks a valuation reset for RIL, which is currently under-owned by FIIs, he said. &amp;quot;As FIIs sell HDFC Bank, IT and FMCG stocks due to bleak outlook, they will redirect funds elsewhere. And, RIL will be a big beneficiary. FIIs can move out of some stocks but cannot move out of Indian markets as a whole, so money is now going to RIL,&amp;quot; Diwan added.  Where is Nifty headed next?  With the Interim Budget just a couple of months away, the Q3 results season still playing out, and valuations slightly out of the comfort zone, the Nifty 50 is expected to remain rangebound.  Going ahead, similar erratic movements may persist ahead of key events, said analysts at Angel One. Immediate resistance for the Nifty is apparent around the 21,850 - 21,950 zone, while immediate support has shifted higher towards the 21,600-21,550 zone.

Hence, if the index manages to hold the momentum, 21,850-22,000 is the area to watch out for on the higher side, which can give the confirmation to the start of a higher-high-higher-low formation, whereas on the other side, 21,600-21,500 is expected to be the near-term support area for the index, experts said.  On January 29, the BSE Sensex rallied 1,241 points or 1.8 percent to 71,942, while the Nifty 50 surged 385 points or 1.8 percent to 21,738 and formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts.

Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Reliance Industries  It is rare to see this stock rally by more than 7 percent in single day. Reliance Industries surpassed its previous record highs of Rs 2,792 level and achieved fresh record highs of Rs 2,905 level which keeps the tone positive for the stock.  Parabolic Sar dots has started to form below the price which is also suggesting that short term bias is bullish. Stochastic RSI (relative strength index) is also confirming the bullish bias as it has given bullish crossover. Stock has shown sharp upside move, buy on dips seems to be a prudent strategy.  In short, Reliance is bullish. Buy on dips can be used to ride the trend as far as price hold Rs 2,790 on the downside for further upside levels of Rs 3,000.    PFC  On the below chart, we can see that stock has given breakout of the rectangular pattern, indicating up move post accumulation. In the previous session, price has closed above Rs 432 with increase in volume. This confirms breakout of the trading range.  Along with this, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has also shown a bullish crossover which is acting as a double confirmation.  In short, trend for PFC looks positive. Use dips towards Rs 432 as a buying opportunity with the target of Rs 465 as long as Rs 410 holds on the downside.    MCX India  MCX price gave breakout from consolidation technical pattern which keeps the tone positive.

This does not bode well for the bulls, suggesting potential challenges in the short term,&amp;quot; Sameet Chavan, head of research for technical derivatives at Angel One, said.  He feels the Budget week is known for volatility, and &amp;quot;considering the above formation we lean towards the bearish side&amp;quot;.  In this scenario, the levels to monitor are around the psychological mark of 21,000, coinciding with 50SMA, and in the case of any negative surprises, the Nifty may decline towards 20,800 or even towards the bullish gap of 20,500, while on the flip side, resistance is anticipated, with 21,500 and the last week's high of 21,750 seen as formidable obstacles before Nifty targets the recent landmark high of around 22,100, he said.

The company&rsquo;s stock has delivered a strong performance.  Since the low of October 2023, the company&rsquo;s stock has surged 23 percent on the NSE, ending trading at Rs 2,734.9 on January 19.  Here are 10 key things from the earnings:  1) Net Profit  Reliance&rsquo;s consolidated net profit grew by 10.9 percent on-year to Rs 19,641 crore for the December quarter of the current financial year 2023-24.  The major drivers for profitability were the consumer businesses and the oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segment.  2) Revenue  Consolidated revenue for the third quarter came in at Rs 2.48 lakh crore, growing 3.2 percent from the year-ago period, supported by continued growth momentum in consumer businesses.  3) Operating Performance  Reliance&rsquo;s quarterly EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased by 16.7 percent on-year to Rs 44,678 crore, led by growth across all businesses.  The double-digit growth in consolidated EBITDA was driven by 31.1 percent growth in Reliance Retail Ventures and 49.6 percent jump in oil &amp;amp;amp; gas.  The oil-telecom-to-retail giant expanded its consolidated EBITDA margin to 18 percent for the quarter, up by 210 basis points over the corresponding period last fiscal.  4) Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms registered a strong 11.6 percent on-year growth in net profit at Rs 5,445 crore for the quarter, while the revenue was at a record high of Rs 32,510 crore, growing 11.4 percent YoY, with ARPU (average revenue per user) increasing 2 percent YoY to Rs 181.7 with better subscriber mix partially offset by unlimited data allowance on 5G network.  The 5G rollout accelerated the subscriber addition momentum. Jio continued to outpace the competition, with 11.2 million net additions in Q3FY24, taking the subscriber base to 470.9 million, while the customer engagement on the Jio network remained strong, with total data and voice traffic increasing 31.5 percent to 38.1 billion GB, and 7.9 percent to 1.37 trillion minutes, respectively, from a year earlier.  The company has rolled out the Jio True 5G network across India ahead of schedule. About 90 million subscribers have been migrated to Jio&rsquo;s 5G network. &ldquo;The strong uptake of the JioBharat phone and JioAirFiber services has resulted in the continued expansion of Jio&rsquo;s subscriber base, contributing to the stellar growth numbers of the digital services business,&rdquo; Mukesh D Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, said. 5) Reliance Retail  Further,&nbsp;the&nbsp;retail segment has also delivered an impressive financial performance with its rapidly expanding physical as well as digital footprint.  Reliance Retail, too, posted a record quarterly revenue of Rs 83,063 crore, increasing 22.8 percent from the year-ago period, driven by grocery, fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle and consumer electronics businesses.  The segment&rsquo;s net profit jumped 31.9 percent to Rs 3,165 crore for the quarter, while the EBITDA margin expanded by 50 basis points to 8.4 percent, led by operating leverage and continued focus on cost management.  Reliance Retail has expanded its store network, opening 252 new stores, taking the total count to 18,774 stores, while it recorded footfalls of over 282 million across formats, a growth of 40.3 percent from a year earlier.  6) Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas  The oil &amp;amp;amp; gas business (exploration and production segment) also recorded healthy performance for the quarter with a massive 50.2 percent on-year growth in revenue at Rs 6,719 crore, mainly on account of higher volumes partly offset by lower price realisation from KG D6 Field.  Block KG D6 is currently producing around 30 MMSCMD gas and around 21,000 barrels of oil or condensate, the company said, adding the segment posted the highest-ever quarterly EBITDA at Rs 5,804 crore.  The average price realised for KG D6 gas was $9.66/MMBTU (metric million British thermal unit) in Q3FY24 against $11.32 in Q3FY23, while the average price realised for CBM gas was $15.55 per MMBTU against $20.92 during the same period. &ldquo;KG D6 is now contributing 30 percent of India&rsquo;s gas production, fueling its transition towards a greener and cleaner tomorrow,&rdquo; Ambani said. 7) Oil to Chemicals (O2C)  The O2C segment delivered resilient performance aided by operational flexibility and strong domestic demand.  The oil-to-chemicals segment quarterly revenue fell 2.4 percent on-year to Rs 1.41 lakh crore primarily due to lower price realisation led by a 5.3 percent decline in average Brent crude oil prices from a year earlier.  The O2C EBITDA for the quarter marginally increased by 1 percent to Rs 14,064 crore led by higher gasoline cracks and advantageous feedstock sourcing. This was partially offset by lower downstream chemical margins and planned maintenance and inspection shutdown, Reliance said, adding the margin expanded by 40 basis points to 10 percent for the quarter.  The company's&nbsp;&nbsp;planned maintenance and inspection shutdown of CDU, FCCU, delayed coking and ROGC complex impacted yields and profitability. O2C EBITDA would have been higher on YoY and comparable on QoQ basis if all major units had been available during the quarter.&rdquo;  8) New Energy Business  The New Energy Giga Complex is all set to be commissioned in the second half of CY24. &ldquo;I am confident that Reliance&rsquo;s New Energy business will play a pivotal role in the global movement for adoption of cleaner fuels,&rdquo; Ambani said. 9) Media Business  The media business delivered strong operating performance across verticals. TV News business revenue was up 23 percent from a year earlier, driven by the strong growth in advertising revenue across clusters. Digital News business delivered 20 percent growth in revenue, driven by intellectual property events and video monetisation across digital platforms.  10) Increase in tax cost and debt on books  Tax expenses for the quarter ended December increased by 22.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 6,345 crore, while the depreciation jumped by 26.7 percent to Rs 12,903 crore for the quarter on expanded asset base across all the businesses, higher network utilisation in the digital services business and ramp-up in upstream production.  The company's finance costs during the quarter increased by 11.3 percent to Rs 5,789 crore compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to higher loan balances and higher interest rates.  The outstanding debt on its books at the end of December FY24 stood at Rs 3,11,743 crore, increasing from Rs 3,03,530 crore at the end of December FY23, while the net debt rose to Rs 1,19,372 crore, from Rs 1,10,248 crore during the same period.  However, the net debt to EBITDA ratio improved to 0.67 at the end of the December quarter, from 0.72 as of the same period last year.  Reliance reported capital expenditure for the December quarter at Rs 30,102 crore with investments in pan-India 5G rollout, expansion of retail infrastructure and new energy business. The capital expenditure in the same quarter last year was Rs 37,599 crore.  Disclaimer: MoneyControl is a part of the Network18 group.

In a regulatory filing on January 12, billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led company said, &amp;quot;Board of Directors of the Company is scheduled to be held on Friday, January 19, 2024, inter alia, to consider and approve the standalone and consolidated unaudited financial results of the Company for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2023.&amp;quot;  Shares of RIL on January 12 closed 0.80 percent higher at Rs 2,740.10 apiece on BSE.  Reliance Industries Ltd&nbsp;(RIL) reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 19,878 crore in the second quarter of the financial year 2023-24, an increase of 29.7 percent from a year ago, despite a dip in revenue from its oil-to-chemicals business. The robust performance of its retail, Jio and upstream businesses drove profit growth.  Gross revenue from operations of India&rsquo;s most valued company stood at Rs 2.55 lakh crore in the quarter ended September 30, compared to Rs 2.52 lakh crore last year. RIL&rsquo;s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) increased by 30.2 percent to Rs 44,867 crore in Q2FY24.  Revenue for Reliance&rsquo;s O2C business, its biggest business, stood at Rs 1.47 lakh crore, a 7.3 percent decline, primarily on account of a sharp 14 percent year-on-year decline in crude oil prices that resulted in lower price realisation for products.  EBITDA for the quarter stood at Rs 16,281 crore, increasing 36 percent from the year-ago period, on account of strength in gasoline and PVC margins, optimised feedstock sourcing and lower SAED in line with the decline in middle-distillate cracks.  The company&rsquo;s oil and gas revenue, representing its upstream operations, increased 71.8 percent in the quarter, driven by higher production of gas &amp;amp;amp; oil and the commencement of condensate production from MJ field along with 6 percent higher gas price realization in KG D6.  Jio Platforms&rsquo; profit for the second quarter stood at Rs 5,297 crore, an increase of 12 percent. The telecom and streaming business segment&rsquo;s revenue from operations stood at Rs 31,537 crore in the quarter, compared to Rs 28,506 crore in the same period last year. The average revenue per user (ARPU), an important metric to measure the performance of telecom companies, improved 2.5 percent YoY to Rs 181.7 per user, per month.  Reliance Retail posted a net profit of Rs 2,790 crore in the quarter, an increase of 21 percent. Revenue from operations for the quarter stood at Rs 77,148 crore, a growth of 18.8 percent YoY.

RIL share price touched a new all-time high of Rs 2,778 on January 15, rising over&nbsp;one percent. Jio Financial Services has jumped about&nbsp;seven percent in the last&nbsp;five sessions, and as much as&nbsp;five percent to a high of Rs 269 on January 15.  Technical analysts say the RIL stock may be headed into an uncharted territory past Rs 3,000, or even Rs 3,100. Jio Financial Services, on the other hand, has a strong support at about Rs 230, above which, it is expected to remain in a strong trend.  RIL stock to continue rising: Rs 3,100 on cards, but with some hiccups  &ldquo;Call writers seem to be stuck in RIL stock; heavy call presence is still visible despite the recent move. Moreover, leverage in RIL futures has remained low, which bodes well for a continued upward move,&rdquo; said Raj Deepak Singh, Head of Derivative Research at ICICI Securities. &ldquo;We expect the stock to remain positive in the short term, and levels near Rs 2,650 are likely to act as major support.&rdquo;  ALSO READ: Reliance Industries at a new high; Goldman Sachs, ICICI Securities see further gains  &amp;quot;With the 2,600-2,630 zone maintained as the support level for RIL stock, the near-term target is anticipated around Rs 2,860. With strength sustaining, further targets of Rs 3,020 and Rs 3,130 can be achieved in the medium-term time frame. From current levels, the overall trend would turn weak only after a decisive breach below Rs 2,500 -- significant 50 EMA zone,&amp;quot; said Shiju Koothupalakkal, Technical Research Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher.  Multi-month breakout seen in RIL stock; major support at this level  &ldquo;Reliance stock has witnessed a strong rally in the last two months, and has recently given a clear breakout above the previous peak and resistance of Rs 2,635 to strengthen the trend. With almost a &lsquo;3 white soldiers&rsquo; pattern indicated on the daily chart and the bias maintained strong, further rise is expected,&rdquo; Koothupalakkal added.  &amp;quot;Reliance has seen a strong move in the previous week and witnessed a multi-month breakout on the technical chart. The last two months have been very strong for the counter in terms of price action. Looking at the recent developments, one may expect the up move to continue,&amp;quot; said Osho Krishan, Sr. Analyst - Technical &amp;amp;amp; Derivative Research, Angel One Ltd.  &amp;quot;RIL stock is placed into uncharted territory, having a strong support of the breakout neckline around the Rs 2,620-2,600. The counter seems poised to continue its upward move with some in-between hiccups, but as long as it sustains above the mentioned zone, it is most likely to carry momentum in favour of bulls. The technical target for the counter based on chart setup is near Rs 3,000, but being an index heavyweight, we expect a gradual move over a period of time,&amp;quot; said Krishan.  Jio Financial Services: Positive traction maintained; check target price, support  Regarding Jio Financial Services, &ldquo;There has been positive traction in the recent period, and we expect the gradual up move to continue in the near term,&rdquo; said Krishnan. &ldquo;On a level-specific note, Rs 230-220 should act as a cushion to any short-term blip, with strong support placed around Rs 210-200,&rdquo; he added.

The&nbsp;strong upmove&nbsp;came on the back of heavy trading volumes, after Goldman Sachs reiterated its Buy rating on the stock, while downgrading rating on other oil stocks.

This revision incorporates updated projections for refining and chemical margins, lowered telecom earnings estimates due to delayed tariff hike assumptions and adjustments to the capacity ramp and margin for the new energy business.  Despite the downward revisions in earnings estimates, the 12-month Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) based target price for RIL has been revised higher by 8 percent. &amp;quot;This revision accounts for roll forward of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) for consumer businesses, which helped offset the impact of lowered earnings estimates,&amp;quot; Goldman Sachs said.

ONGC share price has rallied about 30 percent in the past six months but Goldman believes there is limited upside to ONGC&rsquo;s earnings due to windfall taxes on crude oil and a domestic gas price cap.  For Indian OMCs, it believes&nbsp;share prices have rallied ahead of fundamentals while there is limited upside potential to marketing margins as oil price remains in a relatively higher range of $70-90 per&nbsp;barrel.

Ambani emphasised that Reliance Industries, which operates the world&rsquo;s largest single-location oil refining complex and telecom networks across India, will never be complacent and will continue to disrupt markets.  &ldquo;We are known for disrupting the market through constant innovation and reinvention. We have shown the courage to set the bar high and the ability to jump even higher to create new records,&rdquo; Ambani said, addressing employees on Reliance Family Day, the birthday of group founder Dhirubhai Ambani.  He added that his oil-chemicals-telecom conglomerate is aiming to secure its place among global leaders in digital data platforms and artificial intelligence (AI) adoption.  &ldquo;As India races ahead to become the world&rsquo;s third-largest economy, an unprecedented opportunity awaits Reliance. Reliance can &hellip;. and Reliance will &hellip; grow to be among the Top 10 business conglomerates of the world. For this, we need to be laser-focused on three things,&rdquo; he said.  Reliance started as a small textile manufacturing unit in Mumbai but then ventured into the petrochemical sector to provide feedstock for textiles, ultimately becoming the nation&rsquo;s largest producer. Subsequently, it set up the largest oil refinery in the country and then expanded it to the world&rsquo;s biggest single-location refining complex.  In 2005, it entered the retail sector and is now the largest operator of grocery stores, hypermarkets, and online retail in the country. In 2016, it launched the telecom service Jio, which quickly became the largest operator in India and the third largest in the world.  Today, Reliance is building giga-scale factories for new energy businesses and has also forayed into financial services.  Today, Reliance is building massive factories for new energy ventures and has also ventured into financial services.  &ldquo;We have shown the courage to set the bar high and the ability to jump even higher to create new records. This is how Reliance has achieved perennial growth,&rdquo; Ambani said.  On artificial intelligence (AI), Ambani said Reliance Industries must &ldquo;boldly embrace data and AI to become better at decision-making and resource utilisation.&rdquo;  &ldquo;We need to be at the forefront of using data, with AI as an enabler for achieving a quantum jump in productivity and efficiency,&rdquo; he said, adding that growth engines of Reliance &ndash; digital services, green and bio-energy, retail and consumer brands, O2C (oil-to ) and materials business, and health and life sciences &mdash; will have to complete this transformation by next year.  Reliance is India&rsquo;s largest corporation by revenue, profit and market value.  Ambani asked employees to be &lsquo;laser-focused&rsquo; on providing extreme value to customers through collaboration and systems improvement. &ldquo;In the coming years, we must continue to strive even harder to develop products and services that no one has created ever before,&rdquo; he said.  At the same time, the company&rsquo;s actions must always win community trust, he said, adding that the group must continuously enrich competencies and capabilities.  &ldquo;When all our businesses grow exponentially, we can contribute more to India&rsquo;s inclusive prosperity and make the world a better place,&rdquo; he said.  Ambani said his three key messages for the New Year are to consolidate Reliance&rsquo;s place among global leaders in digital data platforms and AI adoption, consolidate its place among global leaders in talent enrichment, and secure its place among global leaders in institutional culture.  &ldquo;As Reliance reinvents itself to become a unique new-age technology company, we need to boldly embrace data and AI to become better at decision-making and resource utilisation.  &ldquo;In the era of digital platforms, data has become a new factor of production along with talent and money. We need to be at the forefront of using data, with AI as an enabler for achieving a quantum jump in productivity and efficiency,&rdquo; he said.  All growth engines of Reliance -- digital services, green and bio-energy, retail and consumer brands, oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and materials business, and health and life sciences -- will have to complete this transformation by next year, he said.  &ldquo;Furthermore, we should accelerate our efforts to become a pioneer in developing AI to address, at scale, India&rsquo;s urgent national priorities in education, healthcare, agriculture, and employment creation,&rdquo; he said.  To make Reliance an AI-immersive tech company, it needs to build the necessary talent, skill sets and competencies at all levels within the organisation, Ambani said. &ldquo;We should expand and deepen our talent pool to be amongst the best in the world. Investment in talent brings higher returns than investment in machines,&rdquo; he added.  On institutional culture, Ambani said the most important tenet of Reliance&rsquo;s culture is to work with the founder&rsquo;s mindset. &ldquo;It means working with the ownership mindset.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Each and every one of you become an owner of Reliance when you own the founder&rsquo;s purpose and passion,&rdquo; he told employees.  For the younger generation joining the business, Ambani said, &ldquo;Young leaders will commit mistakes. That&rsquo;s for sure...But my advice to them is simple: Do not waste your energy on conducting a post-mortem on past mistakes. Rather, learn not to repeat the same mistakes.&rdquo; Ambani said Reliance must be forever kept young by ensuring that the average age of all teams remains in the 30s.  He also advised the employees to &ldquo;be bold, courageous and adventurous in pursuing your present and future goals.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Let me reiterate: The future of Reliance belongs to Akash, Isha, Anant and their generation,&rdquo; he said, referring to his three children and also mentioning that at a time when Reliance is undergoing a Generational Transition, &ldquo;I attach immense importance to further strengthening this unique Institutional Culture.&rdquo;  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

According to a Bloomberg survey of 14 brokerages, the conglomerate&rsquo;s consolidated net sales are expected to come in at Rs 2.14&nbsp;lakh crore&nbsp;and net profit is estimated at Rs 16,995.50 crore according to&nbsp;seven brokerages. The company is scheduled to report its June quarter earnings on July 21.  &amp;quot;EBITDA to marginally increase by 1&nbsp;percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 38,800 crore, with O2C EBITDA down 4&nbsp;percent to Rs 15,600 crore on lower GRMs, partly offset by a recovery in the petchem margins. We expect net subscriber addition of 6.5 million for Jio, with a 1 percent higher ARPU at Rs 180. Retail EBITDA should be up 2 percent QoQ to Rs 5,000 crore, while upstream EBITDA would be largely flat. We estimate consolidated adjusted PAT, after JPL-RRVL MI, to decline 14&nbsp;percent to Rs 16,500 crore, on higher ETR quarter on quarter at 22 percent,&amp;quot; said Emkay Research in a note to investors.  The Mukesh Ambani led-conglomerate hit its 52-week high on the bourses on June&nbsp;19&nbsp;at Rs 2,855.00 a share on BSE ahead of the result, driven by the demerger of its financial services arm. On July 20 at closing, shares were settled at Rs 2619.80, up 1.2&nbsp;percent from its previous close.  Although RIL does not report gross refining margins (GRMs) separately, analysts expect that it would have achieved GMRs of $11 a barrel in the June quarter compared to the implied GRM of $13/barrel in Q4FY23. It is seen following the declining trend in benchmark Singapore GRM, which has plunged over 70&nbsp;percent year-on-year and close to 50&nbsp;percent QoQ on weak demand.  The analysts predict that the company's petrochemical EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) is likely to remain relatively unchanged QoQ&nbsp;due to limited pricing power in the market. The ample supply and insufficient demand are the primary factors contributing to this situation. In the &lsquo;oil and gas&rsquo; segment, EBIT is expected to have remained stable, with a modest 1.6&nbsp;percent QoQ&nbsp;increase in revenues.  Brokerage firm JP Morgan predicts that Reliance Jio will maintain its pattern of quarterly net subscriber additions and experience a slightly higher average revenue per user (ARPU) in the first quarter. As for Reliance Retail, it is expected to achieve a YoY revenue growth of 25&nbsp;percent. This growth will be driven by the expansion of stores and the acquisition of floor space, particularly in the grocery segment. JP Morgan also foresees that Reliance Retail's revenue growth will surpass that of its competitors in the industry.  &amp;quot;We expect Jio to report strong net adds of 7 million in Q1 (vs 6.4 million in Q4) and largely flattish ARPU leading to overall revenue growth of 1.6&nbsp;percent QoQ. Jio, unlike Bharti, didn't have any benefits from the minimum tariff recharge. Furthermore, we think as Jio's 5G network is deepening, a lesser number of users did top-ups in this IPL-heavy quarter as 5G provided better speeds,&amp;quot; said BofA in its note.  &amp;quot;We expect steady momentum at retail and factor in 22 percent YoY growth (19&nbsp;percent in Q4) led by continued uptake in grocery and fashion business. We model a flattish&nbsp;QoQ EBITDA margin of 7.1&nbsp;percent and EBIT margin of 5.4 percent,&amp;quot; the report added.  According to analysts, the focus is likely to shift towards expectations for significant announcements during the annual general meeting (AGM), which is anticipated to take place in August. Historically, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) uses the AGM as a platform to reveal value-unlocking catalysts and outline future growth plans.  At the last AGM on August 30, Mukesh Ambani told shareholders that he will share an update on the planned initial public offer (IPO) of Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio in the AGM next year. Hence, analysts expect noteworthy announcements to be made during this year's AGM.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

The rating agency affirmed its 'BBB+' rating - equivalent to the sovereign rating assigned to India - to Reliance (RIL) with a stable outlook, reflecting the view that RIL's cash flows will help it preserve its financial profile, despite elevated investments over the next 24 months.  In a statement, S&amp;amp;amp;P said Reliance's expansion plans for the next two years are manageable. Capex will remain elevated, but lower than the levels of fiscal 2023 (ended March 31, 2023).  The company's leverage will remain at a level commensurate with the current rating, it said. &amp;quot;RIL's operating performance will remain resilient over the next 24 months,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;Earnings growth from RIL's digital and retail segments will continue. This will temper weakness in the O2C business.&amp;quot;  The company, which operates the world's largest single-location oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat and is India's biggest petrochemical producer, has in recent years diversified into telecom and digital space, including OTT as well as physical and online retail.  &amp;quot;We believe the company's oil-to-chemicals (O2C - a significant contributor to the company's revenue and EBITDA) segment will continue to maintain more stable and superior margins relative to peers'. This is because RIL is one of the largest and most complex refiners globally.  &amp;quot;The company should therefore be able to withstand a likely weakening in refining margins in Asia amid an economic slowdown and a high base,&amp;quot; S&amp;amp;amp;P said.  Petrochemical demand, it said, is expected to pick up, with China reopening its economy earlier this year, after a pandemic-induced lockdown. This will drive up petrochemical margins from the lows of fiscal 2023.  &amp;quot;We expect EBITDA for RIL's O2C segment to decline 23 per cent in fiscal 2024, before improving 6 per cent to Rs 50,500 crore in fiscal 2025. EBITDA was Rs 62,100 crore in fiscal 2023,&amp;quot; it said.  Earnings in the digital services segment will benefit from increasing data demand and resultant upgrades to higher-priced telecom plans. Meanwhile, new store openings and the proliferation of e-commerce will support the retail business.  &amp;quot;We project RIL's adjusted annual EBITDA will be Rs 1.3 lakh crore to Rs 1.5 lakh crore over the next two years, compared with Rs 1.4 lakh crore in fiscal 2023. We expect the digital and retail segments to constitute about 60 per cent of RIL's total EBITDA by fiscal 2025, compared with 25 per cent in fiscal 2019,&amp;quot; the rating agency said.  RIL's investment plans are sizable but manageable.  &amp;quot;The company's strategy to diversify and dominate its related industries has pushed up its investment spending. We expect this momentum to continue, with annual capital investments of Rs 1.1 lakh crore to Rs 1.2 lakh crore over the next two years,&amp;quot; it said, adding the leverage will remain at a level commensurate with the 'BBB+' ratings.  Resilient earnings and RIL's commitment to keeping its balance sheet in check will support leverage.  &amp;quot;The stable outlook reflects our expectation that RIL's strengthening cash flows and disciplined spending will help the company to preserve its financial profile over the next 12-24 months,&amp;quot; it said.  S&amp;amp;amp;P said it could lower the rating if RIL's capital expenditure, including acquisitions in digital or retail businesses, is higher than expected or cash flow projection for the company reduces due to lower earnings stemming from underperformance in any key business.  The rating could be raised if the company demonstrates a track record of conservative financial policy, such that its debt-to-EBITDA stays well below 2x. A higher rating could also require the digital and retail segments' competitiveness to further strengthen.  Disclaimer:&nbsp;&nbsp;Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

While state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) continue to hold prices despite a drop in international rates, private fuel retailers have started passing on the benefit to consumers.  &amp;quot;To further stimulate domestic consumption and cater to local customers better, we have introduced a Re 1 discount in our retail outlets until the end of June 2023,&amp;quot; a spokesperson for Nayara Energy said.  &amp;quot;We believe in being a strong partner to India's energy needs and will continue to serve the country's consumption demand.&amp;quot; Nayara Energy, which owns over 7 per cent of India's 86,925 petrol pumps, is selling petrol and diesel at Re 1 per litre less than that by IOC, BPCL and HPCL in 10 states such as Maharashtra and Rajasthan.  Earlier this month, Jio-bp, the retail fuel joint venture of Reliance and bp, started selling superior grade diesel at Re 1 per litre cheaper than normal or regular grade diesel sold by state-owned companies.  The additive-enhanced diesel helps clean dirt deposits in engines and can improve fuel efficiency.  While Reliance-bp has priced only diesel less than that of PSUs, Nayara is selling both diesel and petrol at rates below state-owned firms'.  IOC, BPCL and HPCL had frozen retail prices when international oil prices climbed in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. While international oil prices have declined, retail prices continue to be on hold for a record 14th month in a row as they recoup the losses suffered last year.  Prices of crude oil, which is turned into fuels like petrol and diesel at refineries, shot above USD 100 per barrel on concerns of supply disruptions in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February last year. While there was no supply disruption, rates continued to remain firm for months thereafter.  To insulate domestic consumers, they stopped daily price revisions from April 6, 2022. As a result of selling fuel below cost, IOC, BPCL and HPCL posted a combined net loss of Rs 21,201.18 crore during April-September.  During this period, private fuel retailers Reliance BP Mobility Ltd (RBML), Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy and Shell lost market share as they were unable to match the below-cost frozen rates of dominant public sector retailers.  But a fall in international oil prices since March has helped bring their retail prices at par with PSU competition or at market price.  IOC, BPCL and HPCL too have broken even but continue to hold retail prices to recoup past losses. This has helped IOC and BPCL post profits in 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023) fiscal year despite losses in the first half.  Industry sources said Nayara started pricing petrol and diesel at market rates sometime in March and RBML's 1,574 petrol pumps began selling diesel at par from this month.  This month, Jio-bp introduced superior-grade diesel at rates lower than even the normal diesel sold by state-owned firms. Nayara has followed suit with a similar discount on both petrol and diesel in 10 states.  IOC, BPCL and HPCL first froze petrol and diesel rates for 137 days beginning early November 2021 when five states including Uttar Pradesh went to the polls. A second round of hiatus began on April 6, 2022, and is continuing.  Nayara Energy owns 6,376 petrol pumps in the country.

On April 3, OPEC+, announced a surprise supply cut of around 1.16 million barrels per day (bpd), in addition to the earlier cuts, from May till the end of 2023. In October 2022, OPEC had agreed to cut production by 2 million bpd.  Crude oil prices have been on an upward trajectory since the OPEC announcement.
