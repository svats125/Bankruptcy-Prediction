According to a report by The Financial Express, while the total admitted claims of creditors, mainly banks, stand at Rs 57,121 crore, liquidation value of the 124 firms has been pegged at just Rs 4,817 crore.  Liquidation values of around dozen other companies have not been determined as yet. The total admitted debt of all 136 stressed companies stands at around Rs 57,378 crore, including claims of both financial and operational creditors.  Some of the stressed companies undergoing liquidation are REI Agro, with a total debt of Rs 8,626 crore, Gujarat NRE Coke (Rs 5,251 crore), Rotomac Global (Rs 3,944 crore), Roofit Industries (Rs 3,943 crore) and Gupta Coal India (Rs 3,895 crore), among others.  In comparison, creditors recovered Rs 49,783 crore of admitted claims, around 56 percent of the total, from 32 stressed firms for which resolution plans were approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) by the end of June.  The haircut in old cases is unavoidable as most of these companies had been stressed for years before the IBC was introduced in 2016, analysts were quoted as saying. As a result,&nbsp;liquidation at scrap value was the only natural outcome, they said.","banking, Business, IBC",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/lenders-may-be-staring-at-92-haircutrecoveries124136-stressed-firms_11428101.html

The CBI had also issued a Look Out Circular against him.  Promoter Sandip Jhunjhunwala was also arrested by the agency here today.  The agency had registered a case against them and the Kolkata-based REI Agro, which deals with Basmati rice exports, in October 2015.  The action was taken on the complaint from a consortium of 14 banks led by UCO Bank.  It was alleged that the company had defrauded the banks to the extent of Rs 3,871 crore since 2013 through conspiracy, cheating and forgery, the spokesperson said.  It is alleged that the company cheated the banks using 150 shell companies, on the basis of fixed commission, through a group of brokers by creating false invoice, documents of money transfers for non-existent transactions, CBI sources said.  They said Jhunjhunwala was also facing a case of misappropriation of AED 160 million for which the UAE authorities had issued a Red Corner Notice against him.","Business, Rei Agro",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/cbi-arrests-rei-agro-chairman-promoter_8870201.html

The Kolkata-based rice-exporting food company &amp;amp;mdash; which has an outstanding loan of about Rs 5,200 crore &amp;amp;mdash; has informed the stock exchanges that Surendra Joshi, an operational creditor, has filed an application at National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) at Kolkata. The NCLT has initiated corporate insolvency resolution process and Anil Agarwal is appointed as interim resolution professional. The powers of the board have been suspended and they are now vested on Anil Agarwal. Following the NCLT order, a moratorium is granted to the company. UCO Bank-led consortium of 21 lenders to REI Agro had alleged that the company had made fraudulent transactions and diverted funds through forgery. According to reports, the forensic probe on it conducted showed that there is some shortage of the assets which probably could have been some diversional files. UCO Bank had an exposure of approximately Rs 850-860 crore. After the exchange filing, the shares of the listed firm dipped 2.08 percent to end the day&amp;amp;rsquo;s trade at Rs 0.47 per share. As on September-end 2016, REI Agro had posted a net loss of Rs 66 crore as against a loss of Rs 256 crore in the September quarter in 2015.","Anil Agarwal, bankruptcy and insolvency law, Business, National Company law Tribunal, Rei Agro, UCO Bank, wilful defaulter",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/lenders-invoke-bankruptcy-law-against-rei-agro_8609261.html

As many as 21 banks had extended loan of Rs 5,262 crore to REI Agro Ltd, a basmati rice trading firm, and the RBI has sought a detailed clarification from these banks after the fraud was detected, sources said. The clarifications were sought in the light of RBI's master circular on fraud, sources said, adding that there seems to be violation of its directions on fraud. Out of 21 banks, 20 banks reported the account as fraud and one bank had sold the account to Asset Reconstruction Company. The consortium led by UCO Bank alleged that the company had defrauded them through conspiracy, cheating and forgery and handed over the case to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) 8 months ago. CBI too in their enquiry found that the REI Agro was involved in fraudulent activities. As per the RBI master circular on frauds, banks are required to put in place a framework for loan frauds directing early detection and necessary corrective action by introducing Early Warning Signals (EWS) and Red Flagged Accounts (RFA) for loan of Rs 50 core or more There is also provision of incentive for prompt reporting, staff accountability exercise within six months.
