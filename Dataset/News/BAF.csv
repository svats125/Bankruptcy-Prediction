Market analysts view these challenges as temporary and anticipate that the NBFC giant will continue to perform well in the long term due to its extensive franchise and earnings potential.  According to Moneycontrol&rsquo;s analyst call tracker, Bajaj Finance received 29 'buy' calls, two 'hold' calls, and four 'sell' calls from brokerages in the past month, mirroring similar figures from the previous quarter.      Despite this positive sentiment, Bajaj Finance's share price has witnessed a decline of over 13 percent in the past month, against a 1 percent decrease in the benchmark Sensex.  ALSO READ:&nbsp;Analyst Call Tracker: Why some analysts are sceptical about Power Grid despite the stock rally  Bajaj Finance&rsquo;s equity raise to offset RBI&rsquo;s risk-weight norms, say analysts  In mid-November 2023, the RBI announced measures to curb the unbridled growth in select segments of consumer credit, especially unsecured lending by banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). These measures included the imposition of higher risk weights for &lsquo;qualifying loans&rsquo; of commercial banks and NBFCs by 25 percentage points each and an identical hike in risk weights for on-lending by banks to NBFCs.  HDFC Securities&rsquo; analysts upgraded Bajaj Finance from 'add' to 'buy', setting a target price of Rs 8,650 per share. They acknowledged that while the RBI's directive on higher risk weights for consumer credit could affect Bajaj Finance's capital adequacy ratios (CAR) (with an estimated 250 basis points (bps) impact on Tier-I at a standalone level), the company's recent equity raise (equivalent to around 17 percent of FY23 net worth) is expected to counteract this impact, allowing for ample growth opportunities.  &ldquo;We expect Bajaj Finance to follow through and gradually re-price its asset side of the balance sheet to absorb the impact of higher risk weights,&rdquo; the brokerage firm noted.  RBI&rsquo;s embargo on Bajaj Finance&rsquo;s e-com and insta EMI card may be temporary  Apart from that, the RBI ordered Bajaj Finance to stop issuing new loans through its 'e-com' and 'Insta EMI card' due to non-compliance with digital lending guidelines, particularly the non-issuance of Key Fact Statements (KFS) to the borrowers under these two lending products.  The central bank introduced the Digital Lending norms in September 2022 to curb unscrupulous growth in instant digital personal loans and to strengthen customer protection.  ALSO READ:&nbsp;Analyst Call Tracker: Cipla falls out of favour despite strong Q3 earnings show  Nevertheless, analysts believe that the RBI's instruction to suspend loan disbursals under Bajaj Finance's e-com and Insta EMI card categories is unlikely to significantly impact earnings in the short term. These segments collectively contribute approximately 12-13 percent of disbursement volumes and around 4 percent of disbursements by value.  &ldquo;Our base case forecasts currently assume a couple of quarters of embargo, which is likely to reflect in little impact on FY24 growth. However, we expect lower headline growth to be offset by better pricing environment on the back of relative easing in competitive intensity,&rdquo; said analysts at HDFC Securities.  Bajaj Finance Q3 scorecard  Bajaj Finance posted a smaller-than-expected rise in third-quarter profit for a second straight quarter, as it set aside more money for bad loans. The company's consolidated profit after tax (PAT) rose 22.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) in Q3 FY24, while revenue from operations grew 31.28 percent YoY.  In Q3 FY24, gross non-performing assets (NPA) and net NPA stood at 0.95 percent and 0.37 percent, respectively, against 1.14 percent and 0.41 percent in the corresponding period last fiscal.

Stable asset quality and strong AUM (assets under management) growth will drive earnings, as per analysts","All eyes will be on Bajaj Finance today, January 29, as the non-banking financial company (NBFC) will declare its December quarter results. As per&nbsp;a poll of six brokerages, the lender's consolidated net profit is expected to rise 25 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,716 crore.  An average of four brokerages shows that net interest income&nbsp;is expected to rise 26 percent YoY to&nbsp;Rs 9,344 crore. Stable asset quality and strong AUM (assets under management) growth will drive earnings,&nbsp;as per analysts.    Bajaj Finance, on January 3, declared provisional numbers for the December quarter&nbsp;AUM. On the back of a strong festive season, the company's AUM crossed the Rs 3-lakh-crore mark for the first time in&nbsp;the quarter gone by,&nbsp;surging 35 percent YoY.  As per the Q3 update, its&nbsp;deposit book grew by 35 percent to Rs 58,000 crore. During the quarter, it booked 98.6 lakh new loans, a YoY growth of 26 percent.  Margins and costs of funds  According to domestic broking firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services margins and spreads are likely to decline sequentially by ~25 basis points and 15 basis points, respectively. Credit costs are expected to rise ~10 basis QoQ to ~1.7 percent.  Axis Securities also sees margins declining by ~10-15 basis points QoQ owing to an inch-up in cost of funds. Inching up of the cost of funds is an industry-wide trend, noted Jefferies, due&nbsp;to the lagged repricing of MCLR-linked loans.  One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Analysts at&nbsp;KRChoksey Research have pegged the cost-to-income ratio at&nbsp;34.2 percent versus 34.7 percent in Q3 FY22.  Factors to watch  In November 2023, the Reserve Bank of India asked Bajaj Finance to stop issuing new loans through its &ldquo;eCOM&rdquo; and &ldquo;Insta EMI Card&rdquo; for non-compliance with digital lending guidelines. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to watch out for management commentary on the same.  Bajaj Finance Q3 results also come after&nbsp;RBI's caution against unsecured lending and risk-weightage increase for consumer credit. While analysts are confident of Bajaj Finance's liquidity position on the back of Rs 10,000 crore fundraising, it will be crucial to monitor management&nbsp;commentary on how Bajaj Finance's borrowing mix&nbsp;will change going ahead as banks' lending to NBFCs slows down.

Other operating income grew 20% YoY, and net total income (NTI) increased 28% YoY to INR77.7b. 4QFY23 NIM (calc.) declined ~25bp QoQ to ~13%. Driven by its liability strength, BAF was able to tide over FY23 without margin compression. However, we model NIM compression of ~40bp in FY24, due to the expected rise in the cost of borrowings and the difficulty in passing on interest rate hikes in unsecured business loans/personal loans. We estimate an AUM/PAT CAGR of ~26%/24% over FY23-FY25 and expect BAF to deliver a RoA/RoE of 4.6%/24% in FY25. Key factors to watch out for in FY24: 1) the evolution of its payments landscape and adoption of its payments offerings; 2) traction/ momentum in the web platform, and 3) the degree to which the NIM compression can be offset with lower cost ratios and credit costs.  Outlook Maintain BUY with a TP of INR7,080 (premised on 5.3x FY25E BVPS).

Factors that drove earnings beat in Q4 FY23 were resilient NIM (supported by lending rate hikes taken so far) and restrained opex growth (manifesting early benefits of digital platforms). Management remains reasonably confident about strong customer additions, loan bookings, AUM growth, cost metric improvement and benign credit cost in FY24. We have marginally upped our AUM growth forecast and pruned credit cost estimates which has led to FY24/25 earnings being upgraded by 4-5%. Addition of new product lines like Gold Loans, Auto loans, CV finance, Tractor loans, Microfinance and Emerging Corporate loans would support long-term growth and profitability of the franchise.

Customer franchise expanded to 66 mn (up 19% y-o-y) with cross-sell franchise at 38.6 mn (up 23% y-o-y). NIM (calculated as a percentage of average AUM) was stable q-o-q at 10.5% despite cost of funds increasing by 23 bps q-o-q.

Asset quality was remarkable, as GS3 ratio sequentially declined to 1.14% (vs. 1.17% in Q2FY2023) and GS2 ratio (including OTR) dipped to 1.2% (vs. 1.4% in Q2FY2023). AUM growth is moderating to 25-30% vs. earlier at 35-40% owing to a higher base and competitive intensity, which continues to remain elevated across the portfolio that is leading to some market share loss in the near term. This has led to de-rating in the valuation multiples. However, we believe the impact of digital transformation is yet to be visible fully, which should uplift AUM growth gradually.
