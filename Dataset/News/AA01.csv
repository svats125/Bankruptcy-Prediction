Many of Amtek&rsquo;s lenders are now directing their anger at Sanjeev Gupta, Chairman of London-based metals company Liberty House, which, after placing a winning bid to acquire Amtek Auto, backed out abruptly at the last moment, scuppering the bankruptcy process.  It&rsquo;s not the first time that Liberty House has stumbled after placing a winning bid. This has been a pattern, lenders say. It has reneged on two previous occasions &mdash; one after emerging as the top bidder for ABG Shipyard and the other in the case of Adhunik Metaliks in a similar way.  Angry lenders have since sued Liberty House and want the firm barred from bidding for distressed assets in India under the Insolvency &amp;amp;amp; Bankruptcy Code (IBC).  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a colossal loss for lenders,&rdquo; a senior banking executive, who was on the committee of creditors of two of these assets, said on condition of anonymity. &ldquo;We want Liberty House to be blacklisted. In the case of Adhunik Metaliks, we will appropriate the Rs 55 crore that has been paid to us (by Liberty House). But we also want Liberty House to be penalised for the cost of delay in resolution and for how much the asset has deteriorated since their resolution plans were approved.&rdquo;  More than a year after being declared the successful bidder, Liberty House has failed to pay the Rs 4,400 crore it offered to acquire Amtek. Gupta also reneged on the resolution amount for Adhunik Metaliks, where he offered Rs 600 crore against a combined loan default of Rs 5,000 crore by the metals group. In the case of ABG Shipyard, Liberty House was the sole bidder, offering Rs 5,200 crore (with Rs 400 crore upfront) against the Rs 18,245 crore that the shipbuilder owed banks.  All three cases are now heading towards liquidation. In March, Liberty House also withdrew its resolution plan for Amtek Ring Gears, a unit of Amtek Auto, long after being declared the winning bidder. The insolvency court imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh on Liberty House for its casual approach to the resolution process, but allowed it to withdraw its bid.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still possible to revive Adhunik Metaliks,&rdquo; the banker said. &ldquo;We have received some interest from miners in Odisha who are keen on the steel plant, some private equity investors and a large auto component company. But it&rsquo;s unlikely any of them will match Liberty House&rsquo;s bid. The liquidation process in this case has been stayed for now. In the case of Amtek Auto, I don&rsquo;t know if Deccan Value Investors (which had originally offered a competing bid of about Rs 3,150 crore) is still interested. We intend to follow through on the criminal charges against Liberty House and Sanjeev Gupta.&rdquo;  In May, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, the bankruptcy regulator, charged Liberty House and its senior executives with wilfully breaching the terms of the Amtek Auto resolution plan.  A year ago, when Mint had interviewed Gupta, the London-based entrepreneur said he wanted to make an investment commitment of as much as $10 billion to India. Liberty House is part of the Gupta Family Group Alliance, a closely held but loosely linked collection of the family&rsquo;s various business interests in the UK, European Union and Australia.  In July, Liberty Steel completed a 740 million euro acquisition of seven major steelworks and five service centres across seven European countries from ArcelorMittal, after which it became one of the world&rsquo;s top 10 steel producers outside China.  Gupta&rsquo;s plan at the time, he said, was to manufacture &lsquo;green steel&rsquo; in India from steel scrap that he could source from breaking old ships at the shipyard, and then send it down the value chain of steel-making at Adhunik and manufacture auto components at Amtek.  In response to questions over doubts about the credibility of his offers and his funding lines at the time, Gupta had said: &ldquo;In my opinion, (we should be) welcomed with open arms rather than with questions. We&rsquo;re not taking money from anybody but using our own money. Where are you coming from, where is the money from &mdash; why are there these questions?&rdquo;  A spokesperson for Liberty House did not respond to emailed queries for this report.  &ldquo;I believe Liberty House found it difficult to raise the funds needed to follow through on their resolution commitments,&rdquo; said an investment banker, who advises several resolution applicants. &ldquo;In India, most acquisition funding raised for stressed assets has been through local banks, which are comfortable lending to, say, JSW Steel (for Monnet Ispat) or Tata Steel (for Bhushan Steel). They are less comfortable lending to an outsider like Liberty House, whose foreign credit lines may not be accessible for India.&rdquo;  &ldquo;What a resolution plan can offer also depends on industry cycles,&rdquo; said the investment banker. &ldquo;With the massive slowdown in the automobile sector in India, auto component makers have been hit hard. It&rsquo;s a bad time to put money into the business and easier to let the resolution plan lapse. Liberty House may have been keen on steel-making, but will be much less interested now in non-core assets, like the shipyard and Amtek Auto.&rdquo;  Though IBC took off with much fanfare, three years on, it is struggling to close several of the original &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; bad assets even as bankruptcy courts heave under the burden of too many cases being filed. &ldquo;First, IBC is seeing endless delays. And now, there are cases such as these, which fail at the last mile,&rdquo; the investment banker said. &ldquo;The story of this financial year is that IBC is not the preferred option for banks if they want to resolve bad loans. They want to stay out of the legal system and take one-time settlements instead, either from existing promoters or new buyers.&rdquo;","Business, IBC, Liberty House, Sanjeev Gupta",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/lenders-upsetsanjeev-gupta-for-taking-libertytop-bids_12909081.html

Amtek Auto was among the first list of 12 companies which were referred by the RBI in 2017 to respective banks for initiation of insolvency process for defaults.  UK-based Liberty House was selected as the highest bidder by the committee of creditors (CoC) of Amtek Auto. However, it later backed out citing some reasons following which the lenders requested 90 days more time to find a new buyer.  A three-member bench headed by Chairperson Justice S J Mukhopadhaya directed the Chandigarh bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to pass an order of liquidation as 270 days mandated under IBC for finalising a resolution plan have already lapsed.  &amp;quot;We are neither inclined to give any direction as was sought for by the CoC nor to exclude any period calling for fresh Resolution Plan,&amp;quot; NCLAT said in an order Friday.  It further said,&amp;quot;more than 270 days having passed, the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) will pass appropriate order of liquidation, which will be in accordance with law.&amp;quot;  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) mandates completion of insolvency process within 180 days with an extension of 90 days, failing which liquidation has to be initiated against the corporate debtor.  NCLAT also observed that there was no extraordinary situation in the resolution process of Amtek Auto to exclude 90 days period.  &amp;quot;In absence of any extraordinary situation and the fact that more than 270 days have already passed, we find no ground to exclude any period,&amp;quot; it said adding &amp;quot;once a plan is approved by the NCLT under Section 31, if it is not implemented, that cannot be a ground to exclude any period.&amp;quot;  NCLAT also observed that the CoC could request NCLT for considering a pending resolution plan or to call for a fresh one only if the earlier resolution plan is approved within the stipulated deadline.  Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process of Amtek Auto was initiated on July 24, 2017 by NCLT and lenders of the company had selected the resolution plans by two firms - UK-based Liberty House Group Pte Ltd, and Deccan Value Investors LP.  Later, Deccan Value Investors withdrew from the race and a revised plan of Liberty House was selected by the CoC on April 2, 2018 with 94.20 per cent votes.  However, Liberty House backed out from the race and even refused to furnish the performance guarantee and other terms and conditions which were approved.  Following this, the CoC encashed Liberty House's Rs 50 crore Bid Bond Guarantee and requested NCLT to grant another 90 days to the resolution professional (RP) to make another attempt for a fresh process and to debar the UK-based firm.  NCLT said there was no scope for going beyond 270 days and starting the process to publish re-advertisement and invite fresh plans etc would defeat the IBC, which mandates time-bound resolution.  Meanwhile, Liberty House informed NCLT that it had found discrepancies in the condition of machineries, valuations and representations made in the Information Memorandum and found it to be incorrect, false and reflecting inflated values.  Liberty House Group alleged that RP was to provide Information Memorandum with the relevant information, including the liquidation value of Amtek Auto.  It further contended that investment of Amtek Auto was overvalued in the liquidation reports and it wanted to submit fresh plan after coming to know about discrepancies.  However, NCLT rejected all pleas, following which all parties approached the appellate tribunal -- NCLAT, which also declined to extend the deadline.  Over contentions by Liberty House for non-compliance of its offer for Amtek Auto, NCLAT said it &amp;quot;cannot be deliberated by this Appellate Tribunal&amp;quot; as the grounds shown by it were &amp;quot;genuine or it attracts punishment&amp;quot;.  It has given liberty to RP and CoC of Amtek Auto to move an application before NCLT &amp;quot;to decide as to whether the matter is required to be referred to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India or the central government for taking any action.&amp;quot;","Amtek Auto, Business, Market news, NCLAT",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/nclat-orders-liquidationamtek-auto_12900881.html

The Committee of Creditors (CoC) led by Corporation Bank informed the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) that the second highest bidder Deccan Value Investors LP is also considering to submit a revised offer.

Amtek Auto has a total debt of Rs 12,603 crore and the liquidation value of its assets was determined at Rs 4,119 crore.  Liberty House had offered Rs 4,025 crore, including upfront payment of Rs 3,225 crore and a fresh infusion of Rs 500 crore for stabilising and improving operations.  However, Liberty House backed out of the process.  Earlier this month, NCLAT had allowed the withdrawal of Liberty House's bid for ARGL, an Amtek subsidiary.  Amtek is an integrated auto component manufacturer with operations across forging, iron and aluminium casting, machining and sub-assemblies.  In July 2017, NCLT had admitted insolvency proceedings initiated by a consortium of banks led by Corporation Bank.","Amtek Auto, Business, Market news, NCLAT",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/lenders-ask-for-fresh-roundbidding-for-amtek-auto-at-nclat_12306121.html

During the proceedings, senior advocate A S Chandiok representing Liberty House said that once the CoC recommends the adjudicating (NCLT) after selecting the highest bidder, it does not have power to call it back.  &amp;quot;If somebody wants to give more money, then we are ready to look at it. They should tell us the new amount, which they are getting,&amp;quot; said Chandiok.  In March last year, Liberty House, part of Sanjeev Gupta's global industrial group GFG Alliance, said it emerged as the successful highest bidder for Amtek Auto.  Following which, RP of Amtek Auto submitted resolution plan as approved by CoC to the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) for approval under section 30 of Insolvency &amp;amp;amp; Bankruptcy Code.  However, Liberty House made no payments despite repeated requests from the RP to do so, the lenders said.  It has also not submitted a bank guarantee of Rs 100 crore to lenders, following which they filed an application before NCLT to cancel the approval as it failed to pay.

The banks want to run a coordinated auction process to ensure that the timeline for circulation of proposals to prospective buyers and the receipt of final bids and resolution plans remain the same for all the entities on the block.  Many of Videocon's group companies have inter-linked operations, which is why it would be easy for bidders to submit combined bids for a group of entities rather than different plans for each, sources told the newspaper.  Lenders are trying to avoid an Amtek Auto-like situation where bidders had to submit a separate resolution plan for all entities with linked operations, which ultimately delayed the whole process, a banking official was quoted as saying.  The proposal was discussed by all the lenders, led by State Bank of India, in a meeting on&nbsp;September 17&nbsp;where&nbsp;many stakeholders gave inputs as to how this process can be made simpler. Legal advisors and resolution professionals were also present at the meeting.

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Sanjeev Gupta, Chairman of Liberty House Group spoke about the latest happenings in his company and sector.

The deal is all-cash and we will not take on any debt, said Gupta.  This deal will be our first big entry into Indian auto sector, he further mentioned.  Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.  Prashant: You have emerged as H1 for Amtek assets, could you talk to us a little bit about that, where does it go from here, what is the haircut, have you been asked to sort of come up with a revival plan or where does it stand as of now?  A: We have been chosen as H1 preferred bidder which means we now have to basically complete the transaction. We have been chosen as the company to buy that business. Our resolution plan has been accepted and we need to now go through the formalities of completing the acquisition.  Ekta: Could you share with us the details of the transaction or what it might entail in terms of say taking over debt and what kind of equity value would you see in the company?  A: Those details will be disclosed once the acquisition actually completes. They are still confidential.  Prashant: Broadly could you talk to us in the ballpark, what is the kind of haircut, etc. that banks are taking on this?  A: Some of that information is there in the public domain and we are bound by agreements not to talk about it.  Prashant: Could you tell us how much debt will you take on?  A: It is all cash bid, there is no debt.  Prashant: What is the turnaround plan for the company, at least the broad outlines for it?  A: This business is a good business. It is one of the leading automobile component businesses. We have already the leading auto components business in the UK which actually includes some of Amtek's units which we acquired through the UK administration process. So it combines very well with our business, we have a clear plan on how to revive this business and how to increase efficiency and increase volumes. So as soon as we complete the process, we will implement those plans.  Ekta: Just wanted to touch upon the fact with regards to the UK assets which you had taken over of Amtek. Can you just tell us how exactly that is performing at this point and what exactly was the turnaround plan that was implemented there?  A: They are performing extremely well. The turnaround plan there was -reasonably simple, it required engagement with the OEMs. We are already the largest OEM supplier in the UK so we had already an existing great relationship with them. So in partnership with them, we made certain further investments, certain changes to the business and we got the business on a place which is now performing extremely well.  Ekta: This would mark your entry into India, in the auto component segment?  A: It will mark our entry into India. This is our first big step into India and we are all very excited about it.  Ekta: Can you tell us what kind of prospects do you see for the auto component business in India specifically and what are the synergies that we could see between Amtek Auto UK as well as your India business? I am sure there might be some cost savings that you are considering already?  A: India is one of the most prospective markets for auto. It is expected to grow rapidly and it is expected to become a key market for the sector. We have been eyeing this for some time. There is great synergy between India and UK and other parts of our portfolio, there is a lot of products which can be made in various jurisdictions - the infrastructure side, technology transfers, and platform transfers. So there is a lot of cross vertilization. Also of course there is a great deal of synergy with our businesses in steel and aluminium.  Prashant: I am going to circle back to what I began by asking you which is essentially if you could give us some outline on the bid itself. What is the structure, you said it is in all cash, you do not assume any debt, is the payment deferred payment over a number of years, just some outline of what the bid is going to look like, has looked like?  A: There is no deferred payment. Quantum and details I cannot go into but there is no deferred payment, there is no debt being taken.  Prashant: I want to ask now turn to Bhushan Power, you made the bid after the deadline ended, right? Banks rejected it, you went to NCLT, what is the status now?  A: I think the next hearing is tomorrow.  Prashant: What is your primary sort of argument going to be because you are essentially saying you are the highest bidder?  A: Our argument is that we are making a bid which we believe is a superior bid and in interest of all stakeholders - creditors and employees, it should be considered that is our basic argument.  Prashant: We understand that the confusion arose because there was some and this we understand from people in the process, that there was some confusion aabout the deadlines for the Bhushan Steel bid and the Bhushan Power bid, is that what happened, just to understand the background to this?  A: There is lot of confusion in many of these processes I do not blame anybody for that because it is the first time India is going through this, it is historic event. So obviously there will be some degree of confusion. We got caught up in that also. We chose to focus on Bhushan Power but we got caught up in some of that confusion.  Prashant: What is your understanding as far as Amtek is concerned, how much haircut are banks having take? You are saying that your bid is going to be superior, so you have some idea?  A: We have made the highest bid and we have been accepted as highest.  Ekta: I just wanted a quick comment with regards to the subsidiaries that Amtek has currently. I think Castex Technologies and Metalyst Forgings, any plans for that?  A: Yes they are synergetic businesses and it is just how they were structured previously but they all work together. So we will be targeting those as well.  Prashant: Any other assets you are looking at apart from these two?  A: I think it is fairly well known there are three assets we chose to focus on one was Bhushan Power and Steel, other was Amtek, and third was ABG Shipyard. Those are the three we focused on in the first round. Second round, we have some targets also, but it is still early days.  Ekta: You can divulge the other sectors that you might be interested in in the Indian market.  A: Sector wise, as far as NCLT process, these are the sectors actually but beyond that we are interested in financial services and we are interested in construction, we are interested in further engineering, so all the sectors we are in, which is steel, aluminium, auto, aerospace, defence, renewable energy.  Ekta: Would it primarily be an inorganic route that you are adopting to enter these sectors that you are interested in?  A: Not only inorganic, although there is a good opportunity at the moment with this turnaround which is happening in India, the focus on inorganic. However, we are globally a mixture of both organic and inorganic.",Business,https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/amtek-auto-deal-will-be-our-first-big-entry-into-india-auto-sector-sanjeev-gupta_10618061.html

It holds 4.08 per cent of the total value of the financial debt","The NCLAT has said financial creditors cannot recover any amount from a defaulter's bank account without the nod of the Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) during the corporate insolvency resolution process.  Declining relief to the Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) against Amtek Auto's IRP Dinnkar T Venkatsubramaniam, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) said that once moratorium is declared, financial institutions have to act &amp;quot;on the instructions of IRP&amp;quot; with respect to the corporate debtor's account.  &amp;quot;... Once moratorium has been declared it is not open to any person including 'Financial Creditors' and the appellant bank (IOB) to recover any amount from the account of the 'Corporate Debtor', nor it can appropriate any amount towards its own dues,&amp;quot; said the NCLAT bench headed by Chairperson Justice S J Mukhopadhaya.  The appellate tribunal said Section 17 (1)(d) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code says that financial institutions maintaining the accounts of the corporate debtor have to act on the instructions of the IRP in relation to such accounts and furnish all information relating to it.  &amp;quot;We find no merit in this appeal, therefore, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order dated October 13, 2017,&amp;quot; it said.  The NCLAT was hearing the plea of IOB, which is one of the financial creditors of debt-ridden auto component maker Amtek Auto. It holds 4.08 per cent of the total value of the financial debt.  However, it granted IOB 'liberty' to raise its claim before the IRP and &amp;quot;request him to allow it to be a member of the Creditors Committee which should be considered in accordance with law.&amp;quot;  Earlier, the adjudicating authority had also rejected IOB's contentions, following which it approached NCLAT.  Amtek Auto defaulted on repaying Rs 824-crore loans granted by a consortium of lenders, led by Corporation Bank.  In July this year, the Chandigarh bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had accepted the insolvency proceedings against Amtek Auto initiated by the consortium of banks led by Corporation Bank.","Business, India, NCLAT",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/irp-nod-must-for-recovering-moneydefaulter39s-bank-ac-nclat_10083401.html

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.  Anuj: You are handling Amtek Auto, explain to us how this process under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is going to pan out because the whole talk here is will equity have any value, how these companies are going to go in this whole IBC process?  A: Inherently equity has no value. That is the reason why debt has to take a haircut and that is the reason why you are in IBC. So, clearly equity has no value and the whole process of an insolvency professional (IP) is to report to a creditors committee and the aim of creditors committee as well as the IP is to maximize recovery for a creditor.  Anuj: But that is a textbook definition.  A: That is the reality also.  Anuj: Is the reality as well for example for Amtek Auto?  A: It will be for anybody. I will explain to you in brief. Anybody including a promoter would want to preserve value because almost every promoter has given a personal guarantee. Whatever overflows as a non-recovery out of an IBC process will actually still remain as an onus to the promoter in terms of his guarantee. So, clearly it is very important for any promoter, in any of these 12 cases to make sure that they retain value, collaborate with an IP or the bankers or anybody else.  I think everybody is on the same side of the table as far as the IBC process is concerned. Now, what will happen, the conflict is that when the resolution plans come on the table within 180 or 270 days, that is when a promoter will also bid for his own assets and that is where I think the promoter will move to the other side of the table so to say because he will also want to bid for those assets along with external bidders.  Surabhi: He also will then in that case have to cough up capital.   A: Absolutely, so, at the end of the day the promoter now is in par with any other external person who will have the same level of information which an IP will facilitate to bid for a company. However, the reality is in the interim period, both will try to preserve value because unless value is preserved, the net delta will always fall into a promoter because of his personal guarantees.  Anuj: The reason I asked that question is because we heard news reports that for example, Motherson Sumi is looking at Amtek Auto's couple of plants and there are 12 bidders for some of these assets. Some of these are nice assets. In general, you would want promoters to avoid that bankruptcy tag. So, could we have a situation where there is some value for some of these companies?  A: First of all, what is this bankruptcy tag. There are two processes to this bankruptcy code. One is on day one the promoter is not bankrupt. He is into administration i.e. insolvency. During their 180 day period, the plants are valid, just that the debt has to be right sized, equity zero I am presuming, the debt has to be the right size for somebody to come and bid for the assets. As you said, some are attractive, but they are attractive at the right debt levels. And that is what the IBC process will achieve. After the assets, these attractive assets at the right price are actually palmed out, that is when you start creating equity value.  Surabhi: The market is obviously grappling with how to understand this because it is the first time we are getting to something like this. Stock prices have gone completely haywire. They swing from 20 percent up to 20 percent down on any given day. Help us understand this because you are saying that as of now, in reality, equity should be considered zero. So in which case, what sort of options will start coming on the table and how should we value equity for these IBC cases?  A: The expectation of the market is that there will be a haircut in some of these. The equity will get taken over by somebody more credible which could be the promoter tying up with a financier or an outright bidder and that will create minority shareholder value. That is really where the markets are headed and that is where the markets are guessing.  Now, of course, somebody in the earlier session raised the issue as to where is the capital to actually write down some of these laws. That is the reality and that is where the uncertainty comes into the system that while a few banks will be able to take the write off, most banks will not be able to take the write offs. So where will this come? Will this ultimately lead to a liquidation which is a possibility?  Surabhi: What is the chance of that, that was my question? So an absolute downright asset stripping versus actually getting in new buyers whether it is the promoter or a new person coming in and buying out the company?  A: There are deals where we will certainly have buyers, as you have rightly said, some plants of Amtek Auto or currently GTL for example, the telecom towers company is outright for sale. Now that is going to be an equity value deal. But those are different transactions. Some other plants, power plant cost is Rs 8 crore per megawatt, they will not be a buyer.  Reema: This is a time bound process which has to take place. At what stage are we right now in all the 12 deals, as per your understanding?  A: Frankly, most of them we are about to file. We have not even filed.  Reema: In the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) courts?  A: I do not think under the RBI directive, not a single application has yet been filed for the 12 except for, I think Standard Chartered got filed but it got filed outside of the RBI process. It got filed by somebody else. Standard Chartered filed it for Essar. Apart from that, the filing process is yet to start. What has happened is that the consultant, the IP appointments have been shortlisted. But the filings are yet to happen.  Anuj: The NCLT decision can only be challenged in the Supreme Court, right?  A: National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) decision can only be challenged in the Supreme Court and that will be after the 14-day.  Anuj: The sense I got was that most likely Supreme Court will just accept the decision and dismiss the petition.  A: NCLT decisions are primarily based on whether a default has occurred or not. That is the only thing that they are checking really while admitting a petition. I think that is a matter of fact. More or less NCLT decisions are taken in unless promoters, we had initial promoters kind of questioning constitutional validity of IBC and all that, that is all sorted out.","Business, business news, gross non-performing assets (NPAs), Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/insolvency-process-key-challenges-explained-by-abizer-diwanji-ey-india_9175281.html
