While a section of the market continues to believe the re-rating in state-owned companies as a whole was very much warranted, some have turned skeptical.","As PSU stocks went on a free fall over the past three sessions, investors' wealth eroded sharply by over Rs 6.4 lakh crore. The BSE PSU Index saw its steepest drop since January 23, declining by 1.7 percent on February 12.  Top wealth-eroding stocks in the last three sessions include Life Insurance Corp of India and Indian Railway Finance Co, each losing around Rs 41,000 crore in market cap. These were followed closely by Indian Oil Corp Ltd and NHPC, shedding about Rs 25,000 crore each in market cap. NTPC Ltd and ONGC also saw declines of approximately Rs 20,500 crore each in market cap over the same period.  Other notable losses included SBI Cards and Payments and Indian Overseas, down by Rs 20,000 crore and Rs 19,000 crore in market cap, respectively. General Insurance Corp and Coal India faced declines of Rs 17,000 crore each in market cap, while SBI, REC, and PFC Ltd recorded losses of Rs 16,900 crore, Rs 16,800 crore, and Rs 15,500 crore in market cap, respectively.    Prior to this, the BSE PSU index, comprising approximately 104 listed public sector firms, had risen for seven consecutive sessions, surging nearly nine percent during that time and accumulating a 13&nbsp;percent gain for the year.  PSU stocks have been on an upward trend since 2021, with the BSE PSU index experiencing gains for the third consecutive year: 41&nbsp;percent in 2021, 23&nbsp;percent in 2022, and 55.3&nbsp;percent in 2023.    After the sustained run in these stocks, analysts have been cautioning investors. While a section of the market continues to believe the re-rating in state-owned companies as a whole was very much warranted, some have turned skeptical. Recently, Kotak Institutional Equities rejected the recent market optimism on PSUs, expressing concerns about near-term focus, profitability, and potential risks in the medium-term. Despite a surge of 19-443 percent in PSU stocks over the past year, led by various sectors, Kotak expressed concern over &ldquo;highly optimistic assumptions about medium-to-long-term growth and profitability.&rdquo;    Market veteran Madhu Kela said some sections of PSU had become over-valued after the rapid gain over the past few months, thus the correction was neither surprising not unwarranted. He suggests waiting to see where individual stocks stabilize and emphasizes that buying will occur where there is valuation comfort.  &ldquo;Stocks could lose about 10-15 percent as a whole, buying will emerge at the right price. We have to wait and watch.&rdquo; Despite this correction, Kela sees the larger PSU story as intact, attributing it to a robust economy, strong public spending, and government initiatives to empower and enhance the performance of public sector companies.

","State-run insurance behemoth&nbsp;Life Insurance Corporation of India has reclaimed its position as the most valued listed public sector undertaking, surpassing the market capitalization of State Bank of India.  SBI boasts of&nbsp;a market value of Rs 5.63 lakh crore, while LIC has topped it with a market capitalisation (MCap) of Rs 5.64 lakh crore. At 9.30am, the SBI stock declined 1.5 percent to Rs 624, while LIC traded at Rs 896 on the BSE, up 0.2 percent.&nbsp;The&nbsp;benchmark BSE Sensex lost 1.02 percent to 72,386 points.  LIC has gained over 22 percent in 2023 and jumped 7.5 percent so far in 2024, while&nbsp;SBI advanced nearly 5 percent last year&nbsp;and lost over 1 percent so far this year.  The state-run insurer recently said it plans to launch three-four products in the coming months to achieve double-digit growth in new business premium this fiscal year. Chairman Siddhartha Mohanty in a recent CNBC interview expressed confidence in reaching this target, citing an uptick in individual retail business.  LIC also launched a special scheme, Jeevan Utsav, on November 29. The recent surge in the stock is attributed to the buzz around this non-par product, according to Kotak Institutional Equities.  The brokerage believes LIC's marketing force is capable of promoting non-par policies and anticipates the next four months to determine the success of this product. Kotak Institutional Equities retains a 'buy' tag on LIC, citing inexpensive valuations and a price target of Rs 1,040.  Kotak Institutional Equities in its latest note has increased the target price for SBI to Rs 760, maintaining a 'buy' rating. SBI is now Kotak's preferred stock in the PSU sector, attributed to its demonstrated franchise strength over the last credit cycle.  Kotak recommends owning SBI over other PSU banks, stressing on the lender's&nbsp;superior performance in credit cost, liability and asset franchises, as well as digital/technological enhancements. The firm sees no evidence to alter this view, solidifying SBI's position as the preferred choice in the PSU banking space.

Overall APE growth moderated materially to 25.5% YoY in 9MFY23 vs. 36.7% for HY23.

However, much of this growth comes from the group insurance segment as LIC&rsquo;s retail market share is on a downhill","The Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India seems to be walking its talk of regaining its market share and growing at a faster pace than it has been doing in the past few quarters.  LIC&rsquo;s new business premium for the month of November was Rs 24,033 crore, a massive growth of 50 percent. New business growth of all the private sector life insurers put together was a mere 1.9 percent during the same month. Note that LIC&rsquo;s balance sheet size makes this growth rate even more sizeable.  The insurance industry&rsquo;s business metrics for November show that LIC has gained considerable ground versus its private sector peers in pushing policies. On an annualised premium equivalent (APE) basis, LIC reported 30 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in business for November 2022.  Among private-sector life insurers, SBI Life Insurance Company reported an 11 percent growth, and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Corporation reported a marginal fall of 1 percent. HDFC Life Insurance Company reported a 42 percent surge.  To be sure, listed private-sector life insurers have also shown a sharp jump in premium growth.  LIC leads the growth rate on a three-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) basis too. A three-year CAGR growth smoothens out the volatility induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, giving investors a fair idea of the performance of an insurer.  Notably, the expansion comes on a balance sheet size that dwarfs other players. Kotak Institutional Equities notes that the 3-year CAGR growth for LIC was a stellar 42 percent, as of November.  LIC&rsquo;s retail market share falls  What should bother investors is that much of this growth comes from the group insurance segment even as LIC&rsquo;s retail market share is on a downhill.  Growth here hasn&rsquo;t been spectacular with retail APE increasing by a modest 12.8 percent in November, which compares poorly to a 47.6 percent growth of HDFC Life and 30.3 percent for SBI Life. Ergo, the life insurer has lost market share here.  &ldquo;LIC reported muted retail APE growth of 1.3 percent for YTDFY23, resulting in an immense decline in retail APE market share. Moving further, we expect LIC to grow in high single digits,&rdquo; analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services wrote in a note.  The insurer&rsquo;s management has reiterated several times that the company would pursue growth and particularly increase the share of non-participatory products.  Given its vast agency network, LIC&rsquo;s aggression in margin-friendly, non-participatory products does not bode well for private-sector life insurers. In fact, smaller life insurers could face a greater challenge simply because of the balance sheet heft of LIC.  So, will LIC stock price go up?  The stock is down 23 percent from its issue price of Rs 949 at the initial public offer in May to Rs 685 a piece now. Though analysts have taken a favourable look, post the insurer&rsquo;s growth pick-up, LIC&rsquo;s profitability metrics still fall short. This could weigh on the stock.  Private-sector peers are likely to deliver more bang for their buck. Profitability metrics, such as value of new business (VNB) and margins, are superior for HDFC Life and SBI Life.  For instance, in the July-September 2022 quarter, HDFC Life reported a VNB margin of 26.2 percent, second only to SBI Life&rsquo;s VNB margin of 31.6 percent. LIC&rsquo;s margin was a mere 14.6 percent.  Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities continue to keep HDFC Life and SBI Life as their top picks in life insurance. To be sure, growth could moderate for bank-promoted life insurers as lenders get busy pushing deposits and side-line policies.  &ldquo;We do not expect the current month&rsquo;s momentum to continue, especially in the light of rising deposit rates, even as we build consistent moderate gains for HDFC Life. SBI Life, though volatile on month-on-month basis, would continue to gain share over the year&mdash;largely supported by its strong parent,&rdquo; they said in a note.  For LIC, given the vintage of its policies, the extent of profits it can squeeze out is limited. This is already reflecting in its embedded value, which hardly showed an expansion despite the insurer&rsquo;s operating performance being stellar. The contribution of VNB to embedded value &mdash; of around 1.8 percent &mdash; is low for LIC.","Business, Companies, India, insurance, Insurance regulator IRDA, LIC, Life Insurance, sector",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/lic39s-aggression-visibleprivate-insurers-still-winprofitability_16772081.html

Outlook However, we expect operating RoEV to remain modest at 11.8%, given its lower margin profile than private peers. Valuation at 0.6x FY24E EV appears reasonable, considering the gradual recovery in margin and diversification in the business mix. We maintain our Buy rating with a revised TP of INR870 (0.8x FY24E EV).

PAT at Rs166bn was way above our estimates, as the company chose to transfer surplus Rs143bn from its non-par fund to shareholders&rsquo; fund. On net basis, LIC&rsquo;s H1FY23 numbers do not change our opinion on the fundamental challenges of slower growth and sticky cost leading to gradual market share loss in the retail segment and subpar profitability reflecting in poor Embedded Value (shareholder value) compounding. To reflect H1 developments, we adjust our estimates, leading to 6-8% cut in FY23-25E EV estimates. Currently, LIC is trading on FY23E P/EV of 0.7x.

But the big question is whether this is enough for investors who picked up its stock at the IPO to finally get any bang for their buck,"Insurance behemoth Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which commands a 68 percent market share, is trying to convince investors that its profitability is no longer inferior to its private-sector peers. And it has done a pretty good job with its latest quarterly performance.  The life insurer is also serious about getting its growth mojo back and the 2.8-percentage-point market share gain during the quarter is a good start. But the big question is whether this is enough for investors who picked up its stock at the initial public offering (IPO) to finally get any bang for their buck. They are still sitting on a 24 percent wealth erosion despite the 8 percent share price gain over the past month.  The improvement in profitability metrics such as the expansion in value of new business (VNB) and VNB margin goes a long way in giving comfort to investors. The management&rsquo;s outlook, though pithy, does indicate better days ahead in terms of growth and profits too. At a post-earnings call with analysts, LIC executives reiterated that the company is focused on pushing margin-friendly non-participatory insurance policies (which do not pay dividends) that would ensure that it can distribute more profits to its shareholders.  &ldquo;Within the next few years, the product mix could be 25:75 in proportion of par/non-par (participatory/non-participatory). Once that happens, there could be significant change in VNB margin,&rdquo; chairman M R Kumar said during the call.  Note that shareholders also get a greater share of the profits after an accounting change that brought about the one-time tidal wave of surplus to shareholders from policyholders ahead of the IPO. LIC splits its surplus in the 95:5 ratio between policyholders and shareholders now against the earlier ratio of 98:2. Meanwhile, the September quarter numbers provide enough fuel for profitability prospects but not as much for growth.  The whale goes breaching  LIC reported a multi-fold increase in net profit for the September quarter that was partly driven by growth. VNB expanded by 132 percent year-on-year (YoY) while VNB margin rose to 14.6 percent for the September quarter from 13.6 percent in the June quarter.  New business premium grew 24 percent sequentially. For the April-September period, it was up 12 percent compared with the corresponding period in FY22. That said, the growth is slower than the 34 percent clocked in the June quarter. The first half is typically a slower business period for life insurers. Notably, LIC got 68.25 percent of new business during the first six months of FY23 compared with 63.25 percent share for all of FY22.  Another metric that shows LIC&rsquo;s growth prospects are improving is rise in total business on an annualised premium equivalent basis. LIC reported 48 percent growth in its total business. The growth assumes significance when viewed in the context of the massive size of the company&rsquo;s balance sheet.&nbsp;Kumar said that the growth is broad-based, although the focus remains on expanding the share of non-participatory products. Analysts believe that with a greater proportion of growth coming from such products, the company&rsquo;s profitability metrics would only shine more.  &ldquo;Increasing non-participating mix and change in surplus distribution policy are significant growth drivers of the value of the new business (VNB) and in turn embedded value (EV),&rdquo; analysts at ICICI Securities pointed out in their note ahead of the results. The share of non-participatory products has climbed to over 8 percent now from less than 7 percent a year ago. Non-par business has grown by 75 percent, over a low base, of course.  Participatory products allow customers to get a slice of LIC&rsquo;s profits, usually distributed as bonus (dividend) every year. Non-participatory products are those policies where policyholders have no claim over the company&rsquo;s profits.  Some discordant notes  While LIC&rsquo;s new business growth is healthy, its persistency ratios aren&rsquo;t cutting it. The 13th-month persistency ratio was 70.52 percent for the September quarter, down from 75 percent in the previous quarter.  Persistency ratios drop sharply as one goes to longer periods. LIC&rsquo;s 61st-month persistency ratio is just 55.83 percent. What this means is that customers do not stick with LIC for long and let policies lapse. This is detrimental to future profits as insurance is a business where costs are upfront while profits are staggered over the life of the product. Low persistency ratios mean that for every rupee LIC spends on acquiring a customer, it is not getting the commensurate return by way of profits.  Moreover, LIC&rsquo;s expense ratios are higher than peers&rsquo;. Operating expense ratio was 16.69 percent for the first half of FY23 compared with 15.33 percent in the corresponding period of FY22. LIC has a large network of agents and is known to give high commissions to them. The cheaper digital route of acquiring business is yet to bring in a significant share of business although the share is increasing. &ldquo;We will focus on all channels for business and digital will be an important one,&rdquo; LIC executives had said in the call.  It still ain&rsquo;t a show  The impressive increase in margin-friendly non-par business has made all the difference in VNB and margins. But the impact on LIC&rsquo;s embedded value has been muted. Embedded value is the present value of all future profits plus adjusted net asset value of an insurance company. Simply put, it shows how much shareholders would get out of the business already underwritten by the company. LIC&rsquo;s embedded value was flat&nbsp;YoY for the September quarter at Rs 5.44 lakh crore. When life insurers report an increase in the value of business written during a year along with increasing margins, it leads to a boost to the embedded value.  However, in LIC&rsquo;s case this boost has been limited. The management didn&rsquo;t offer a clear explanation but did assure that embedded value would continue to expand in the coming years. As such, LIC will detail its embedded value (based on Indian embedded value calculations) every six months to give investors a sense of the business value. Embedded value is the most preferred metric to judge a life insurance business for valuation. Therefore, LIC would need to ensure that its growth and profitability metrics ultimately result in a big expansion in the embedded value. &ldquo;The H1 embedded value expansion is not that impressive when you see it in the context of the margins and the VNB improvement. Ultimately, EV is the driver for valuation,&rdquo; said an analyst, requesting anonymity.  The life insurer&rsquo;s shares are still 24 percent down from its listing price. They trade at a modest 0.75 times estimated price-to-embedded value, much lower than peers such as ICICI Prudential Life Insurance (at P/EV of 2.2) and HDFC Life Insurance (at a P/EV of 3).  LIC&rsquo;s balance sheet heft and market share have been a reflection of a slow-moving monopoly akin to a whale in the ocean. But for investors to sit up and notice, the insurer has to put up a sparkling show, just like dolphins. So far, the business performance has been mixed.","Business, company, LIC, Life Insurance, Market",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/lic-caninsurance-whale-put-updolphin-show_16720291.html

The shares of LIC fell to their fresh 52-week low of Rs 650 on the National Stock Exchange on June 20 as the investment banker&rsquo;s research wing initiated coverage on the stock with an &ldquo;outperform&rdquo; rating and a price target of Rs 840 a share.  Shares of the life insurer have tanked more than 30 percent since its listing on May 17, driven by concerns over its growth, perceived volatility in its embedded value and concerns over competition from private sector players.  &ldquo;LIC&rsquo;s new business value is only 1 percent of its policies in force. Therefore, with 99 percent of value from old policies, we see the 0.75 times P/EV (price-to-embedded value) as unduly harsh, even assuming no growth,&rdquo; JP Morgan India&rsquo;s research wing said in a note.  The brokerage firm said that LIC has picked up growth recently and expects the same to trend at 6 percent on an annualised basis over the current and next two financial years.  &ldquo;The improved ability of agents post re-opening should drive growth. In the last four months, LIC&rsquo;s retail premium is growing faster than industry (+32% y/y) and is above 2019 level,&rdquo; JP Morgan said.  The brokerage firm is of the view that higher consistency in disclosure of embedded value going ahead could help trigger re-rating in the stock.  &ldquo;In our view, LIC would need to show consistency in EV which would signal accuracy on assumptions used,&rdquo; the brokerage house said.  The stock listed on the bourses at Rs 865 against the issue price of Rs 949. The government raised nearly Rs 21,000 crore by selling around a 3 percent stake in the life insurer through India&rsquo;s biggest IPO, which is now being counted in the ranks of the world&rsquo;s biggest let-downs as far as public issues go.  Brokerages such as Macquarie Securities India and Emkay Global Financial Services, on the other side, have remained neutral on the life insurer despite meaningful correction in the stock price since their initiation of coverage and represent the scepticism around the company&rsquo;s prospects.  Macquarie initiated coverage on the stock in May with a &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; rating, saying that the ability to sell high-margin non-par products&mdash;as opposed to par products that provide policyholders a significant share of policyholder&rsquo;s surplus&mdash; will require a change in the mindset of the organization and its agency force, &ldquo;which could be LIC&rsquo;s biggest challenge in our view&rdquo;.  LIC&rsquo;s shares are currently trading 34 percent below Macquarie&rsquo;s price target for the stock of Rs 1,000 per share.  &lsquo;Elephant that can&rsquo;t dance&rsquo;  Brokerage firm Emkay Global Financial initiated coverage with a &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; rating, arguing that LIC was an &ldquo;elephant that can&rsquo;t dance&rdquo;.  &ldquo;LIC&rsquo;s valuation on price-to-embedded value appears cheaper when compared with listed private players; this is justified by the fact that LIC adds merely 1.0-1.5 percent of EV each year from VNB, as against around 8-11 percent in the case of private life insurers,&rdquo; Emkay Global said in a note in early June.  While all three brokerages which have initiated coverage on the stock agree that LIC&rsquo;s fair value lies close to one time its one-year forward embedded value even though their estimates for embedded value differ, market participants remain far away from that valuation.  As per JP Morgan, investors are valuing the stock at merely 0.75 times its estimate price-to-embedded value.  At 12.05 am, shares of&nbsp;LIC&nbsp;managed to recoup all of their losses and rise 0.6 percent to Rs 658.50 on the NSE but still lacked the enthusiasm portrayed by its former investment banker.

The brokerage firm has initiated coverage on the stock with a &amp;quot;hold&amp;quot; rating with a price target of Rs 875 a share.  The brokerage firm said its &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot; view is underpinned by the low value of new business relative to embedded value, low annual premium equivalent growth and margin prospects and inherent volatility in the embedded value of the company.  LIC&rsquo;s shares have come under pressure since their listing on May 17. The stock has fallen 15 percent from its issue price of Rs 949 a share, leading to losses even for its policyholders who were given a hefty discount of up to Rs 60 a share during the initial public offering.  &ldquo;LIC&rsquo;s valuation on price-to-embedded value appears cheaper when compared with listed private players; this is justified by the fact that LIC adds merely 1.0-1.5 percent&nbsp;of EV each year from VNB, as against ~8-11 percent in the case of private life insurers,&rdquo; Emkay Global said.  The brokerage firm is of the view that LIC&rsquo;s dominant size hides the operational challenges that the country&rsquo;s largest life insurer faces. &ldquo;LIC&rsquo;s dominant share in the single-premium group fund management business artificially inflates its market share and deflates some of its cost ratios,&rdquo; Emkay Global said.  It has valued the life insurer at 0.9 times its one-year forward price-to-embedded value. The brokerage firm has ignored any improvements in the embedded value from the future value of the new business.  &ldquo;The overall EV returns are going to be lower and a mature life insurance company like LIC, with a large back-book and limited new business strain, should be valued closer to EV,&rdquo; Emkay Global said.  It said the unwinding rate, or the rate at which future cash flows are discounted, could be higher than that of private sector peers because of a large portion of equity investment backing non-participant policyholders&rsquo; liabilities.  &ldquo;This is bound to result in higher volatility in EV, potentially feeding into the share price,&rdquo; Emkay Global said.  At 10.10 am, shares of LIC were down 0.1 percent at Rs 809.9 on the National Stock Exchange.
