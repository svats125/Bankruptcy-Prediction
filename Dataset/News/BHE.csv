The BHEL-HPVP has dedicated, intricate manufacturing and inspection facilities for manufacturing of state-of-the-art Compact Heat Exchangers for different types of aircraft manufactured by HAL.  The same are progressively being augmented to meet International Aero Standards (AS9100) and BHEL is ready to meet the requirements of future programs of LCA, ALH, Sukhoi and AMCA.  The BHEL has been a reliable supplier of critical equipment and services in the defence and aerospace sector for over three decades, the statement said.  Significantly, the company has already established specialised manufacturing facilities and capabilities aimed at making a major contribution towards self-reliance in the production of defence equipment, it added.  These initiatives of BHEL will be a driving force towards the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan of Government of India, it further said.","BHEL, Business, Companies, Tejas aircraft",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/bhel-bags-order-to-supply-compact-heat-exchanger-sets-for-tejas-aircraft_16061301.html

Located at NTPC Simhadri in&nbsp;Andhra Pradesh, the 25-megawatt floating SPV project covers an area of 100 acres,&nbsp;Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited&nbsp;(BHEL) said without disclosing the project cost.  ''BHEL has successfully commissioned India's largest&nbsp;Floating Solar PV&nbsp;plant. Notably, with its unique state-of-the-art design, the project is an engineering marvel, created by BHEL,'' the company said in a statement.  BHEL said its scope of work in the project included design, engineering, procurement and construction of the solar project, which has been executed by the company's recently formed Solar Business Division.  The project will help saving valuable land resources and conserving water by reducing evaporation, it said.  It further said this complex module array has been designed for the first time in&nbsp;India&nbsp;to withstand gusts of wind up to 180 km/hr. Given the coastal location of the project site that leads to severe corrosion, all the platform structures and other equipment have been made corrosion resistant, it added.  The engineering firm is the leading EPC player in the solar industry in&nbsp;India, with an overall portfolio of more than 1.2 gigawatts. Its portfolio of floating solar PV projects is also the largest in the country, with more than 45 MW projects commissioned and around 107 MW under execution.  The company offers EPC solutions for both grid-interactive and off-grid, ground-mounted, rooftop, floating and canal top solar plants.","Andhra Pradesh, BHEL, Business, Companies, solar plant",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/bhel-commissions-india39s-largest-floating-solar-plantandhra-pradesh_15536861.html

In response to the critical situation arising out of shortage of medical oxygen in the second half of April, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) has once again risen to the occasion by venturing into the manufacturing of medical oxygen plants, a BHEL statement said.  BHEL's first medical oxygen plant developed and manufactured, using CSIR-IIP technology, was formally handed over to SLG Hospitals &ndash; Hyderabad in a record time of less than 35 days from receipt of order.  It had signed an agreement with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Indian Institute of Petroleum (CSIR-IIP) on May 3, 2021, for the transfer of technology for medical oxygen plants of 500 LPM and higher using pressure vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA) technology. The agreement entails the development and deployment of 500 LPM medical oxygen plants and design upscaling to 1,000 LPM and more.  Work for the development of a prototype was initiated on a war footing in three of BHEL's biggest manufacturing units (Hyderabad,&nbsp;Bhopal&nbsp;and Haridwar).  In parallel, work on design upscaling of 1,000 LPM was also taken up.  The&nbsp;BHEL&nbsp;team, with the support of&nbsp;CSIR, quickly overcame the various challenges such as procurement of zeolite material and other components as well as those faced in the manufacturing process.  The prototype was completed by BHEL's&nbsp;Hyderabad&nbsp;unit on June 11, 2021, in a record time of less than 40 days from the date of signing of the agreement. The company was able to complete absorption of technology, procurement of materials and manufacture of the equipment in this short time. The design for a 1,000 LPM medical oxygen plant has also been completed and the prototype of this unit is also expected to be ready soon.  BHEL has already received commercial orders for the supply of both 500 LPM and 1,000 LPM PVSA plants to state hospitals. The other two units of&nbsp;BHEL&nbsp;are also manufacturing this equipment on a fast track basis, and a total of 10 units are to be supplied in July.  Deployment of these plants will further supplement the efforts initiated by the company during the second wave of COVID-19 towards the supply of medical oxygen, wherein BHEL's units located at&nbsp;Bhopal&nbsp;and&nbsp;Haridwar&nbsp;supplied over 5,75,000 cubic meters (80,000 cylinders) of medical oxygen to hospitals in their vicinity.","BHEL, Business, Companies, oxygen",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/bhel-supplies-medical-oxygen-plantrecord-time_15255421.html
