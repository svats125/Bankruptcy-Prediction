The company has its headquarters at Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh.","Shares of Coal India gained on March 6 after its Chhattisgarh-based subsidiary South Eastern Coalfield (SECL)-run Gevra mine secured the&nbsp;environmental clearance to expand production capacity to 70 million tonnes a year.  The expansion will position Gevra as the largest coal mine in Asia, overtaking Indonesia's Sangatta mine in terms of production.  The Gevra mine, stretching approximately 10km in length and 4km in breadth, has a&nbsp;capacity to produce 52.5 million tonnes of coal every year, which makes it the largest in India.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  SECL is a 'Miniratna'&nbsp;company, and one of the eight fully owned subsidiaries of Coal India. Headquartered at Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, it runs more than 90 coal mines across Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.  The company deploys environment-friendly, blast-free mining technology, including surface miners and ripper mining equipment, in addition to heavy earth-moving machinery such as 42-cubic-metre shovels and 240-tonne dumpers for overburden removal.  The expansion of Gevra mine aligns with India's aim of achieving self-sufficiency in coal production and phasing out imports for power generation by FY26.  In FY23, the company produced 167 million tonnes (MT) of coal and aims to raise it&nbsp;to 200 MT in FY24 and to 260 MT by FY26. It also achieved its highest-ever mineral offtake last fiscal year at 160.05 million tonnes in FY23, with coal dispatch to the power sector reaching an all-time high of 139.92 MT.

Based on the YTD performance, COAL is confident of achieving 770mt of production during FY24, with five subsidiaries on track to achieve 100% of the annual production target. The number is lower than earlier guidance as SECL subsidiary would fall short by 8-9mt due to some pending clearance for mine. Though e-auction premiums have declined in Jan-Feb&rsquo;24 to 35-50% from 117% in 3QFY24, the increase in e-auction volumes (~15% of the quarterly dispatches vs. 8-9%) would largely offset the impact. Domestic power generation is expected to grow by 7.7% to 1,750bu in FY24, which will drive coal demand. Dispatches to coal-fired plants till Jan&rsquo;24 stood at 509mt (up 7.3mt YoY) and are expected to cross 610mt in FY24E. In line with the recent trend in e-auction premiums, we have trimmed our eauction premium for FY26E while increasing e-auction volumes.  Outlook As a result, we have increased FY26E revenue/EBITDA/APAT by 1%/9%/7%. COAL trades at EV/EBITDA of 4.9x FY26E.

On the other hand, volumes had increased 17 percent and stood at 13 percent of sales. At 9:20 am, the stock was trading at Rs 420.50.

The management added that Coal India will bid for three blocks in critical minerals auctions conducted by the country&rsquo;s mines ministry in February.  In a conversation with Moneycontrol, Mayuresh Joshi, Head - Equity Research at William O'Neil said that scaling down production volume was not significant due to wide variation in previous production levels -750 to 780 million tonnes. While the&nbsp;decrease in e-auction premiums spooked the stock, the situation is not believed to be structural in nature and is expected to normalize over time, unless it persists for a long period of time.&nbsp; Going forward Joshi said, that there is an expectation of marginal earnings cut in the next couple of quarters if e-auction premiums remain low. Additionally, infrastructure developments such as evacuation lines and railway lines are expected to contribute to stable output  What brokerages say  Brokerage firm CITI has a neutral call on the stock with a target price of Rs 430 per share. The E-auction volume, according to the brokerage should largely offset the premium decline. The stock has more than doubled in the last year on strong volumes and power demand. CITI values the company at&nbsp;8x Sep&rsquo;25 FY25 P/E.  CLSA has an outperform call on the stock and has raised the target price to Rs 480.

Coal India posted a 17.8 percent increase in consolidated net profit to Rs 9,093.69 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to Rs 7,719.11 crore last year, while its revenue rose 2.8 percent to Rs 36,153.97 crore&nbsp;and consolidated sales increased 4.4 percent to Rs 38,357.23 crore. Its EBITDA surged 13 percent to Rs 13,576.35 crore in Q3 of this fiscal year from Rs 11,973.68 crore a year ago.  The company supplies around 89 percent of its production to the power sector, which constitutes over 80 percent of total power generation in India. To meet the growing coal demands in the power sector, Coal India is aiming for a production of 780&nbsp;million tonnes in FY24, with e-auction dispatches at approximately 15 percent of total volumes.  With India's lag in achieving its FY30 renewable energy target and a 7.2 percent on-year growth target in power generation for FY24, primarily from thermal power, Coal India is poised for strong production in the coming years. Given the robust performance, positive volume outlook, higher e-auction premiums, and reduced costs, Motilal Oswal&nbsp;has increased our EBITDA estimates by 15 percent, 9 percent, and 10 percent for FY24, FY25, and FY26, respectively.  During the quarter, there was an increase in the amount of coal sold through Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) by 9 percent YoY to 172 million tonnes and through e-auction by 8 percent YoY to 15.8 million tonnes. Although e-auction prices were lower at Rs3,321 per tonne compared to Rs5,047 per tonne last year, the impact was partially mitigated by higher FSA prices, which improved to Rs1,532 per tonne, up by Rs 68 YoY.  Nuvama Research expects Coal India to receive performance incentives in Q4FY24 due to a likely surpassing of committed power sector supply. Anticipating a 5 percent annual volume growth from FY24 to FY26, Nuvama foresees stable costs offsetting lower e-auction prices, ensuring robust EBITDA over the next two years. Despite an annual capex of Rs 150&ndash;160&nbsp;billion, the company maintains strong free cash flow of Rs 190&ndash;240&nbsp;billion. Projected dividends per share are Rs 25 in both FY25 and FY26. Nuvama's diversification into power, coal gasification, etc, is scheduled to commence in FY25.  In 2HFY24, Coal India started with Rs 371 billion in cash. Antique Stock Broking says that initially concerns arose about weak cash flow due to provisioning in 1H, and fears of reduced peak cash generation with narrowing e-auction premiums. However, it's now expected that Coal India can sustain over Rs 300 billion in cash generation, exceeding the FY24 capex of Rs 165 billion. This may lead to leftover cash of Rs135 billion, translating to dividends of Rs22 per share.","Buzzing Stocks, Coal India, equity markets, markets News",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/buzzing-stocks/coal-india-keeps-brokerages-upbeatratings-target-price-hikesstrong-q3-earnings_17446521.html

The response in the sixth tranche of linkage auction for sponge iron sub-sector has been rousing with 99 per cent of the total offered quantity of 11.05 million tonne (MT) being successfully booked.  Coal India arms South Eastern Coalfields Ltd (SECL) and Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL) accounted for 86 per cent of the total offered quantity at 9.5 MT.

The capex spend during the first four months of the current fiscal year that started in April, was almost 100 per cent of the target of Rs 4,754 crore and 28.3 per cent of the annual target of Rs 16,600 crore (for 2023-24 fiscal), they said.  Typically, the capex starts slow in the first quarter with the company laying out the expenditure plans at the beginning of the fiscal and gradually builds up in the subsequent quarters.  What makes the 8.5 per cent capex growth in April-July FY24 significant was it came over a high base of Rs 4,332 crore of same period in FY2023, the year when CIL's capex peaked to an all-time high of Rs 18,619 crore.  &amp;quot;At a time when the government has been directing the central public sector units to scale up their capital expenditure for economic revival, CIL in a span of three years has stepped up its capex by three fold (197 per cent).

Land was the major expenditure head at Rs 1,311 crore, accounting for 28 per cent of the total capex spend of April-July 2023. This was closely followed by the procurement of heavy earth moving machinery (HEMM) that took up Rs 1,083 crore or 23 per cent.  Land acquisition and strengthening the modernized mining fleet are twin essentials for sustaining the production tempo, especially when the company is faced with stiff targets.  Capex on construction of rail sidings and rail corridors and coal handling plants and silos, for faster evacuation of coal, was Rs 664 crore and Rs 572 crore, respectively.  Underscoring the company's resolve to shore up evacuation infrastructure CIL said the budgeted provision for construction of rail sidings and corridors at Rs 4,169 crore is the highest among the capital expenditure heads for entire FY 2024.  For land acquisition, a total amount of Rs 2,907 crore was identified for the ongoing fiscal year. While construction of coal handling plants (CHPs)/silos is pegged at Rs 2,174 crore, procurement of HEMM would take up Rs 1,965 crore in FY24. Rest would be on other heads like plant and machinery, solar projects, JVs and coal washeries.  &amp;quot;Our production is poised to increase substantially in the ensuing years and it is vital to align it with seamless coal transportation.

In the past, the miner's attempt to acquire coal assets aboard did not fructify.  In its pursuit of overseas assets, CIL is currently identifying suitable opportunities for mergers and acquisitions, the management informed its shareholders in its latest annual report.  The strategic move reflects the company's vision to secure a steady supply of these critical minerals toward the Atmanirbhar mission of India.  In 2022, the Ministry of Mines also created a joint venture company, Khanij Bidesh India Ltd (KABIL), with participating interest from NALCO, Hindustan Copper Ltd and Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL).  KABIL is mandated to identify and acquire overseas mineral assets of critical and strategic nature such as lithium, cobalt, etc.  In the past, NMDC and Coal India were considered for participation in the special purpose vehicle (SPV).

Coal India has also signed two MoU for its foray into the thermal power business.  The first is for a joint venture between South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL) and Madhya Pradesh Power Generating Company Limited (MPPGCL) to implement a 1x660 MW Supercritical thermal power station replacing the retired generating units situated at the existing premises of MPPGCL's Amarkantak Thermal Power Station, Chachai, district Anuppur, Madhya Pradesh.
