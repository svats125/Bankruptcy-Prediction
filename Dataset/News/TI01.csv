TTAN 3Q24 PAT missed on estimates, led by 200bps lower share of studded jewellery, muted demand in Q3 amid high gold prices &amp;amp;amp; higher completion from smaller and unorganized players (more consumer offers).

We expect improvement in watch margins, however Eye wear seems to be having poor visibility due to heightened competition. TTAN continues to imbibe multiple growth engines led by 1) Jewellery network expansion, regional thrust and sub brands like Mia, Zoya and Caratlane 2) Omni-channel strategy across jewellery, watches and eyewear 3) rising presence in higher growth segments of wearables, dress material, handbags and fashion accessories.

Standalone margins were in line with our estimates. Jewelry segment saw UCP growth of 15% in Q3, led by 15-18% growth in Oct-22/Dec22, while Nov-22 saw relatively-weaker growth trends. Interestingly, Jan-23 has seen robust growth trends of &amp;amp;gt;20% on 3Y CAGR basis which should drive Street&rsquo;s earnings upgrades, in our view. Share of new buyers also rose, to ~49% of total buyers in Q3 vs. 46%/43% in Q2/Q1, pointing to market-share gains. On expected lines, Jewelry margins declined 170bps to 13% in Q3, due to focus on growth and a 100bps one-off in the base. TTAN maintained its near-term EBIT margin target of 12-13% for Jewelry, 13-14% for Watches and &amp;amp;gt;15% for Eyewear. Given strong execution, we remain confident of the high-teens earnings trajectory continuing for TTAN in the medium term. Outlook The stock has corrected ~20% in the last 3 months which, in our view, is unwarranted. We maintain BUY on Titan, with Mar-24 TP of Rs2,940, based on 52x FY25 EPS. Stronger traction in the Taneira/Handbags/Intl. businesses remains a potential upside to estimates.

We believe TTAN is well placed to capitalize on long term growth opportunities led by 1) jewellery share gains due to network expansion, regional thrust and hallmarking benefits 2) Omni-channel strategy across jewellery, watches and eyewear 3) new growth drivers like Caratlane, Titan Eye+, Taneira and 4) entry into high growth segments like wearables such as smart watches, over the head headphones and Truly Wireless earphones.

Base quarter EBITDA margin was the highest since 2QFY06 and hence, there was an unusually unfavorable base, which will not be the case going forward though. The three-year consolidated Sales/EBITDA/PAT CAGR remained robust at over 20% each in 3QFY23.&nbsp; Jewelry sales CAGR was robust too at ~23% in 3QFY23. The management indicated that there has been no impact of gold price increase in Jan&rsquo;23 with the three-year CAGR trend in Jan&rsquo;23 being even better than the corresponding number for 3QFY23. Outlook The ongoing urban discretionary slowdown does not seem to have hit the company&rsquo;s customer base. TTAN has the best-in-class track record, better nearterm growth visibility than peers and the longer-term growth opportunity is also the best of breed, thus deserving high multiples.

The Tata group company is estimated to report a post-tax profit of Rs 985 crore on revenue of Rs 10,656 crore, according to an average of estimates by five brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.  While net profit will grow 22 percent sequentially, it will be largely flat year-on-year (YoY) due to a high base. In Q3 FY22, the company&rsquo;s net profit had zoomed 91 percent YoY on the back of pent-up demand after COVID-19 lockdowns.    &ldquo;Titan is likely to report optically weak numbers off an exceptionally strong wedding season base of Q3 FY22 and Q3 FY21,&rdquo; noted analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.  In its Q3 business update, the company has already informed that combined sales for the quarter grew 12 percent, with maximum growth recorded by the 'emerging businesses' category at 75 percent. This includes fragrance and fashion accessories, and Indian dress wear sold under the Taneira brand.  A total of 111 new retail outlets were added in the quarter across businesses, taking the total count to 2,362.  Keeping the base effect aside, demand momentum continues to be robust, led by the festival season and stable gold prices during the quarter, believe analysts. The Street is forecasting 11 percent growth YoY in the jewellery segment.  The watches &amp;amp;amp; wearables segment is set to register 14 percent growth, while sales from the eyecare business will grow 10 percent YoY, said MOFS. Meanwhile, Kotak Institutional Equities is factoring in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margins at 13.4 percent for jewellery business, 13.8 percent for watches, and 15.5 percent for eyewear.  On an overall basis, operating margins will contract over 100 basis points (bps) YoY as the base quarter had a one-time gain of higher studded realisation, it added.  One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  As per brokerages, the key factors to watch out for will be ― outlook on international business expansion, volume growth trend, commentary on market share gains in the South, update on inventory levels, and capital base movement.
