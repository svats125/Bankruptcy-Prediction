The billionaire Anil Agarwal-led company on Friday reversed an earlier strategy of taking the entire company private, saying it will, instead, spin off into various commodity-focused companies looking to shore up financials after a string of poor results.  The conglomerate's parent, Vedanta Resources, is battling a host of rating downgrades triggered by worries over outstanding dues - $6.4 billion as of May - according to the company.  &amp;quot;The demerger does not solve the debt concern of parent company Vedanta Resources, which must repay about $4.2 billion in debt by FY25,&amp;quot; Nuvama analysts said in a research note, saying the split would not improve Vedanta's credit profile.  Agarwal's attempt in 2020 to privatise Vedanta did not materialise as investors found the de-listing price to be too low. His latest attempt to trim down the holding company's dues by getting its unit, Hindustan Zinc, to buy some of the firm's zinc assets also did not succeed due to opposition from the Indian government, which is a minority shareholder.  &amp;quot;As it will take time to complete demerger, (the process) won't be helpful for the parent company to meet debt obligation.

Analysts also said some of the company's non-core businesses not generating enough cash were likely to be sold after the demerger.

For every share they hold of Vedanta Limited, shareholders will receive one share of each of the five new companies. Currently, Vedanta Ltd and Hindustan Zinc are the group&rsquo;s only listed entities.  However, the latest stance by the management is a U- turn from Vedanta&rsquo;s previous efforts, between 2012 and 2017, to consolidate the stakes in different businesses.  Even as concerns remain,&nbsp;the latest development has led to some positive moves for the stock- which has added another 3 percent in opening deal after rallying nearly 6 percent in trade on Friday.  Even as concerns remain,&nbsp;the latest development has led to some positive moves for the stock- which has added another 3 percent in opening deal after rallying nearly 6 percent in trade on Friday.  Most brokerages have maintained their sell rating on Vedanta post the demerger announcement, barring CLSA, which has revised its rating upwards mainly due to the stock correction but reduced the target price due to capital structure uncertainty. The lack of clarity on debt profiles, reversal of past consolidation efforts, Vedanta&rsquo;s funding gap, and lack of focus on core operations are some of the concerns of these brokerages.  An interesting take has been offered by Investec Securities, which sees the demerger as a strategic move that will eventually make it easier for the promoter to consider monetisation or delisting.  Also read:&nbsp;Vedanta&rsquo;s merger-demerger merry-go-round  Here&rsquo;s what the brokerages have to say:  CLSA:  CLSA has raised its rating for Vedanta from underperform to Outperform due to a significant stock correction observed over the past three months. However, the brokerage has also reduced its target price from Rs 255 to Rs 230. This decision was made based on a lower target multiple, which was influenced by the uncertainty surrounding the company's capital structure and allocation. According to the brokerage&rsquo;s analysis, a crucial factor for a potential re-rating would be a shift in focus towards core operations.  According to CLSA, Vedanta has been adjusting its capital structure for approximately a decade, with the goal of simplification and value enhancement. It believes that this effort was also aimed at reducing leverage at the parent company, Vedanta Resources (VRL). From the brokerage&rsquo;s perspective, this shift has diverted attention away from the core business and diminished investor interest. CLSA now believes that a cleaner holding structure and renewed focus on the core business will help VRL reduce its debt, as it would facilitate the sale of stakes in operational entities and streamline brand fee payments to VRL.  Also read:&nbsp;Vedanta gains 2%, brokerages have mixed views as demerger may ease debt load  Citi:  Citi has maintained its sell rating but changed the target price to Rs 225 from Rs 222. The brokerage reckons that Vedanta&rsquo;s objective in pursuing these actions is to reduce the conglomerate discount and potentially facilitate a stake sale by the promoter. However, Citi has expressed uncertainty about whether these measures would lead to improved multiples, particularly in light of concerns about leverage at both Vedanta Resources and Vedanta. The management's lack of clarification on the debt breakdown has provided limited visibility into independent leverage ratios.  Kotak Institutional Equities:  Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained its &lsquo;Sell&rsquo; rating for Vedanta with an unchanged Fair Value (FV) of Rs 200, primarily due to what it perceives to be an unfavourable risk-reward scenario, and the belief that the demerger alone might not bring about a significant unlocking of value.  The brokerage highlights that this demerger represents a reversal of Vedanta&rsquo;s previous efforts, between 2012 and 2017, to consolidate stakes in different businesses, and contradicts the rationale behind those earlier corporate actions.  Additionally, Kotak Institutional Equities points out that VRL, the parent company, has been facing significant challenges due to its high leverage and a funding gap of $3 billion projected for FY2025. The report mentions &ldquo;divestment of non-core businesses was deemed necessary to address these issues&rdquo;. However, the brokerage, in its analysis, also noted that the demerger on its own might not necessarily unlock any value.  Kotak Institutional Equities emphasised that the reduced fungibility of cash flows and increased cash flow volatility associated with the demerger could pose challenges in obtaining lender approval, especially considering Vedanta's elevated debt levels.  Investec Securities:  Investec has retained its sell rating on Vedanta and maintained its target price of Rs 240 per share. The brokerage sees this as a strategic move because it eliminates the need for a majority of minority approval, facilitates debt allocation, and eventually makes it easier for the promoter to consider monetisation or delisting.  While there is a theoretical argument for expansion on multiple fronts through peer benchmarking, Investec points to potential risks in the new ventures, including inter-group restructuring, carbon-heavy assets, and potential cash-flow challenges. The brokerage has emphasised that it is critical to have clarity on the debt profiles and other financial aspects of the new entities before making a comprehensive assessment.","Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta, Announcements, Vedanta Ltd",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/announcements/vedantaâs-demerger-fails-to-excite-brokerages-stock-adds3_17257601.html

The firm will report its earnings on Friday.  Vedanta's consolidated revenue is expected to decline by 15% year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 32,800 crore. The EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is expected to reach Rs 7,040 crore, down 31% YoY. The adjusted profit is likely to decline sharply to Rs 1,410 crore compared to Rs 4,420 crore a year ago. This reduction is primarily caused by the impact of lower realizations across all business segments of Vedanta, analysts added.  Analysts expect that Vedanta's EBITDA, excluding the Hindustan Zinc division, is likely to decrease by 30% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) due to lower metal prices. The Zinc International and Aluminium businesses are expected to experience EBITDA declines of around 56% and 20%, respectively, primarily due to lower LME prices. However, this impact will be partially offset by an improved cost of production (CoP) due to the availability of coal at lower prices.  Vedanta's aluminium business, the conglomerate's largest segment, will likely face an EBITDA decline of 22% year-on-year led by lower realizations and suppressed global prices, which may be partially offset by lower costs, according to Kotak Institutional Equities.  The steel division may have been affected in the June quarter by both lower prices and reduced volume, contributing to its decline. Additionally, the power segment is also expected to report a decline in EBITDA, considering that the previous quarter (Q4) included a few one-off gains that won't be replicated, analysts added.  &amp;quot;We forecast (1) Aluminum EBITDA to decline sequentially by 5% (-22% YoY) mainly led by lower realizations, partially offset by lower costs (2) Oil and Gas division to witness a -16% QoQ drop in EBITDA due to lower gas prices and likely discounts to OMCs (3) Zinc India division to see a -25% QoQ decrease in EBITDA on the back of a sharp decline in zinc prices,&amp;quot; said Kotak Institutional Equities in its recent note.  Investors will also look out for any announcement on how the company secures funds to support the deleveraging exercise of its parent, the London-headquartered Vedanta Resources.  The cash and cash equivalents of Vedanta have declined due to dividend payouts. Vedanta paid dividends an unprecedented five times in the financial year that ended in March, boosting total disbursements to about Rs 37,700 crore. Analysts suggest that due to the plunge in commodity prices, the ability to pay the dividend of the company will reduce.  Analysts and shareholders will also look for cues on the company's semiconductor business and dividend announcement. Vedanta has reaffirmed its dedication to constructing India's first semiconductor and display fabs in Gujarat's Dholera Special Investment Region, even after the dissolution of its joint venture with Foxconn. The original investment plan was set at $19.5 billion for establishing the semiconductor manufacturing unit.","Result Poll, Vedanta",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/result-poll/vedanta-june-quarter-earnings-likely-to-fall-amid-weaker-commodity-prices-across-segments_17122341.html

Revenue growth was fueled by better performance across all the verticals (especially aluminum, copper and iron ore) during the quarter.
