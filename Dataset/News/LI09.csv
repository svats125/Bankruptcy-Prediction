The growth was affected by higher-than-expected furloughs and a continued slowdown in discretionary spending. However, deal wins were strong at USD1.5b (up 15% QoQ/20% YoY) and management commentary on the deal pipeline was robust. The management has indicated that 4Q growth will mirror 3Q due to persistent pressure on clients&rsquo; spending. 3Q EBIT margin declined 60bp QoQ to 15.4%, missing our estimate by 40bp. Profitability was impacted by higher furloughs and pass-through revenues, despite lower workforce (-1.1k). Attrition continued to moderate (14.2% in 3Q), while utilization improved to 87.4%. Notably, the management has stated that its guidance of achieving 17%+ EBIT margin by 4QFY24 would be delayed by a few quarters.

In addition, weak management commentary triggered a cautious outlook from brokerages that anticipate more pain for the IT major in Q4.

Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  The company also delayed its ambition to achieve 17-18 percent operating margin by a few quarters on account of hiring.  This did not sit well with brokerages as HSBC feels LTIMindtree's worsened Q4 outlook and a pullback on its margin ambitions suggests medium-term portfolio headwinds. The brokerage also cut its price target on the stock to Rs 5,160 to factor in lower growth and margins, however, it retained its 'hold' rating.  Brokerage firm Nuvama Institutional Equities also lowered its price target for LTIMindtree by 5 percent to Rs 7,000 but maintained the 'buy' call on the stock. The firm feels that LTIMindtree's management commentary did not exude much confidence as the company grapples with delayed decision-making and weak macros. On that account, Nuvama also slashed its FY24/25/26 EPS estimates for the stock sharply by 3.2 percent/8.9 percent/ 5.2 percent.  On the other hand, Incred Equities went ahead and downgraded the stock to 'reduce' with a price target of Rs 5,675, disappointed by the company's Q3 miss on earnings.

Adjusting for 4QFY23 pass-through revenue impact, it grew 0.9% QoQ CC. Growth was led by Hi-Tech, Media and Entertainment (+3.2% QoQ) and Healthcare (+5.0% QoQ), while BFSI, Manufacturing and Retail declined QoQ. EBIT margin stood at 16.7%, in line with our estimate. While LTIM delivered strong order inflow of USD1.41b in 1Q, the management retracted from providing FY24 guidance and acknowledged that double-digit growth seems challenging in FY24. Management commentary mirrored its peers on low demand visibility, pushout of deal scale-up despite strong deal flow momentum, and a shift in new wins toward cost optimization from discretionary deals seen over the last two years. The management expects a pick-up in Hi-tech to continue for the rest of the year on the back of strong deal wins. While the budgets remain intact, BFSI and Retail continue to be impacted by slower decision-making and delayed ramp-ups. Given the limited visibility on deal starts, we expect LTIM&rsquo;s revenue growth recovery to be gradual, and estimate FY24 USD CC revenue growth at 7.3% YoY. We continue to see LTIM as well placed to gain from a healthy mix of cost-takeout deals and transformation spending. We expect a strong recovery in FY25, with a USD revenue CAGR of 11% over FY23-25E despite weak macro. LTIM saw 30bp margin improvement in 1QFY24 (in line), partially due to a lower employee base (down 2.2% QoQ). Utilization was up 150bp QoQ (on reclassified base).

Outlook We expect the company to deliver EBIT margin at the lower end of its guidance in FY24 at 16.5%, followed by a 140bp pickup in FY25 to 17.9%.

The mid-sized IT company, which has replaced HDFC in the NSE Nifty, is likely to report revenues of Rs 8,751 crore, representing a 14.5-percent jump YoY but just 0.69-percent higher than the preceding quarter, as per the average of a poll of estimates of three brokerages.  Net profit is projected to grow 9.35 percent yoy and 8.5 percent qoq to Rs 1,209 crore.  LTIMindtree had posted revenue from operations at Rs 7,644.2 crore in the first quarter of the previous fiscal and Rs 8,691 crore in Q4 FY23.  In dollar terms, the company's revenue increased 12 percent on-year to $1.05 billion. Consolidated profit came in flat at Rs 1,114 crore, compared to Rs 1,108 crore reported in Q4FY22.  Also Read:&nbsp;An earning-based non-directional options strategy in LTIMindtree  &ldquo;We expect LTIMindtree to deliver a soft revenue growth of 0.3% QoQ (in constant currency) in1QFY24 due to weak macro and no license component in revenues, which was present in 4Q. We expect EBIT margin to expand by 25 bps QoQ (ex-integration costs) driven by higher utilisation/ merger synergies, offsetting the impact of weak growth,&rdquo; analysts at Jefferies said.  The foreign brokerage expects IT players to be impacted by the continued softness in the discretionary IT spends driving project ramp-downs/deferments, longer sales cycles, and slower revenue conversion due to fewer short-term deals.  Macro Headwinds  Echoing the views, Kotak Institutional Equities expects LTIMindtree to post muted revenue growth of 0.5 percent on qoq basis due to lower pass-through revenue, deal transitions and delayed start to certain engagements in BFSI.  Also Read:&nbsp;LTIMindtree stock enters big league, its operating metrics less so  However, it sees healthy growth in deal wins and 50 bps qoq increase in EBIT margins due to lower pass-through revenues and operational improvements.  &ldquo;We expect investors to focus on -- factors that underpin confidence to achieve double digit growth&hellip;, health of deal pipeline and conversion rates, state of demand in impacted verticals of BFS and hi-tech, positioning in cost take-out deals and vendor consolidation events and levers to offset high wage inflation especially onsite,&rdquo; it said in a note.  Meanwhile, Nuvama Institutional Equities expects LTIMindtree to log revenue growth of 0.7 percent QoQ in constant currency as growth is expected to be weak in BFSI and retail, while hi-tech is expected to rebound.  &ldquo;We expect margins to expand by +42bps QoQ - driven by growth and absence of any major headwind/merge related expense.

EBIT margins improved by 247 bps q-o-q to 16.4% reflecting benefit of lower furloughs, lower integration costs and productivity improvements. Attrition lowered by 210 bps q-o-q to 20.2%. The company guided for double-digit revenue growth in FY24 but expects Q1FY24 to be a softer quarter given possible delay in start of certain BFSI accounts and thus a large part of the growth to be back-ended with a high ask rate for 9MFY24. The management aspires to be in the 17-18% EBIT range going forward but expects the recovery in the margins to be gradual as the order intake is transitioning to cost take-out deals from transformational programs. The merged entity has capabilities and scale (through cross sell and up sell opportunities) to win large deals and same is visible in strong deal pipeline of $3.6 billion (up from $3.2 billion) and order inflow was strong at $1.35billion (up 8% q-o-q) in Q4FY23. Outlook Although Q1FY24 seems to be soft (given global macro headwinds) but was on expected lines and the company&rsquo;s focus on large deal wins along with merger synergies would drive industry leading growth for LTIM. The recent fall in the stock price despite decent growth visibility for medium-term growth makes risk reward favourable for long term investors.

Large deal pipeline remains robust; the company has 68 large deals with TCV of $3.18 billion. The company expects 17%-18% margin levels over the next few quarters, post which it aspires to expand margins by 200 bps by FY27. The management indicated that there are enough margin levers in place for improvement through higher Utilization, lower subcontracting costs and by ensuring that existing resources are billed at the right price. LTI-Mindtree with its diverse set of clients across categories is well placed to leverage to cross sell/ up sell services. The company highlighted that its current cross sell ratio is three with nine service lines and are targeting to reach five; this will provide strong growth even with no new deal wins.

Enterprises are continuing their digital spending in the front-end new age services: Cloud, Data and Security. However, the management remains cautious in specific pockets, where investments might take a pause due to adverse macros. The management indicated that the decision-making cycle is getting elongated in few accounts. With emerging macros, the slowdown might be pronounced, which could affect 1HFY24 performance. As a combined entity, LTIM is in a better position to pursue large deals with its nine distinct complementary service lines. With its horizontal capabilities, the company can work on several small deals, which have strong potential to scale up further and build stickier annuity-based revenue over a longer horizon. The company has designed a GTM (Go-to-Market) strategy while aligning its delivery and functional areas to suit clients&rsquo; requirement. The focus is to amplify capabilities from both entities to have end-to-end presence in the digital transformation areas (core to experience to edge).  Outlook LTIM as a combined entity has deep domain capabilities, strong partnerships with hyperscalers, and a robust sales engine, which will result in industry-leading growth.
