At 11.54 am, shares of Asian Paints were trading at Rs 2,807 on the NSE.  Grasim launched its paint brand, Birla Opus, last week, which aims to attain the second&nbsp;position in the decorative paints market, which is currently being dominated by Asian Paints.  Not just that, Grasim also targets to achieve profitability and a gross revenue of Rs 10,000 crore within three years&nbsp;of commencing full-scale operations. While the bullish targets set by Grasim and an equally comprehensive strategy by the management to make it a reality has ushered optimism from the Street, it has heated things up for Asian Paints.  Even though&nbsp;brokerages believe Asian Paints will emerge as the industry leader after the&nbsp;shake-up,&nbsp;they also feel that it is not the guaranteed winner, hinting towards increased competition. These concerns have also triggered a flurry of downgrades and cuts in price targets for Asian Paints.  Follow our live blog for all the live action  In&nbsp;anticipation&nbsp;of an expected increase in competitive pressure within the industry, brokerage firm CLSA has downgraded Asian Paints to a 'sell' rating. Additionally,&nbsp;the firm also&nbsp;reduced their price target for the stock by close to 25 percent to Rs 2,425. Furthermore, CLSA has adjusted its earnings estimates for Asian Paints for FY25/26, lowering them by 8-10 percent.  CLSA&nbsp;also foresees a potential de-rating for Asian Paints, with its stock price projected to align more closely with its 15-year average multiple.  Goldman Sachs also shares the same concern&nbsp;and thereby&nbsp;reduced its price target for the stock by approximately 14 percent to Rs 2,850, while maintaining a 'neutral' call. Moreover, the firm has decreased its target multiple for the stock from the previous 58x to 52x. Additionally, Goldman Sachs has adjusted its earnings-per-stock estimates for FY25/26, lowering&nbsp;it by 5.2 percent and 10.9 percent, respectively.  Moreover, the stock's expensive valuations have also prompted brokerages to see limited upside in the&nbsp;stock from a&nbsp;near term perspective.

Revenue was in line with our estimate. For 9MFY24, revenue grew by 4.1% YoY to INR 2,67,640 Mn. Q3FY24 growth was supported by the extended festive season, however there was some relative moderation in demand in the latter part of the quarter. APNT saw some recovery in the rural markets. Gross margin expanded by 504 bps YoY/ 24 bps QoQ in the quarter as raw material prices saw further deflation of 0.2% QoQ. The gross margins inched up despite a 1.3% price decrease taken in the portfolio. In 9MFY24, the gross margin expanded by 595 bps YoY. EBITDA for the quarter grew by 27.6% YoY/ 19.8% QoQ to INR 20,561 Mn and was 3.1% higher than our estimate due to lower employee and other expenses. EBITDA margin expanded by 393 bps YoY/ 234 bps QoQ to 22.6%. EBITDA margin expansion was driven by material cost softening, growth in luxury products, and operating, sourcing and formulation efficiencies.

Outlook We make small adjustments to our FY24E/ FY25E EPS of +1.1%/ -1.3% respectively, as we factor in the strong margin performance in Q3FY24 but reduce our revenue assumption slightly.
