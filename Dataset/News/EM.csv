Net profit may climb to Rs 948 crore in the three months ended September from a year earlier, according to the estimates of five brokerages. Revenue may rise by over 15 percent to Rs 4,054 crore. Eicher is scheduled to announce its Q2 results on November 10.   The company&rsquo;s Ebitda margin is likely to expand by 282 basis points to 26.12 percent in the second quarter.  Brokerages attributed the likely rise in revenue to higher domestic sales, accompanied by price hikes. Sales of Royal Enfield motorcycles rose by 10 percent in Q2 from the previous year. Domestic sales helped offset a fall in exports.  Motilal Oswal and Kotak Securities said the increased sales of Hunter models are set to contribute to the rise in revenue. Kotak expects a 7 percent on-year increase in the average sale price per vehicle due to the price increases carried out over the past year.  Margin expansion  Lower raw material costs, the price increases, a favourable product mix and a benign currency are attributed as the reasons for the expected rise in the EBITDA margin despite the lower export volumes.  &ldquo;We estimate EBITDA margin to improve by 30 bps qoq in 2QFY24, led by (1) RM tailwinds and (2) price increases; partly offset by (1) lower export mix and (2) higher advertisement spends due to the launch of Bullet 350,&rdquo; Kotak Securities said.  Prabhudas Lilladher said margins would rise due to &ldquo;operating leverage, inventorisation benefits, lower commodity costs and price hikes.&rdquo; Brokerages expect the commercial vehicle margins to expand for Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles (VECV), the joint venture between Volvo Group and Eicher Motors.  &ldquo;VECV margin is likely to improve YoY/QoQ led by higher CV volumes and moderating discounts,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said.  &ldquo;We expect VECV to report EBITDA margins of 8.3% in 2QFY24 versus 7.8% in 1QFY24 due to RM tailwinds.&rdquo; Kotak Securities added.

However, margins expansion ahead will be gradual ahead as stable RM and price hike (+1.5% in 2Q in domestic) would be partially offset by launch expense related to new Bullet 350 in Aug&rsquo;23. While demand outlook is mixed/weak for domestic/exports, the management sounded confident to navigate increased competitive intensity by playing on RE&rsquo;s strength developed over period of past decade. Further, it has hinted slew of disruptive launches (rather will be spaced out), which should help expand overall mid-size market. We expect RE&rsquo;s overall volumes to grow at ~11% CAGR over FY22-25E (vs -7% CAGR over FY20-22), despite new competitive launches.

Competition has significantly heightened in the 250-500cc segment post the recent launches by both Harley Davidson (in partnership with Hero MotoCorp) and Triumph (in partnership with Bajaj Auto) at extremely competitive and similar price points to RE. While their ambitions are likely to be much higher, even if both these peers together are able to ramp up to 10% of RE volumes over 6-9 months, it would cap RE&rsquo;s future growth potential.

Over the last two days, both Harley Davidson (in partnership with Hero MotoCorp) and Triumph (in partnership with Bajaj Auto) have launched cruiser bikes at extremely competitive and similar price points, which are marginally higher than RE&rsquo;s best-selling Classic350cc (Chrome). What leaves us confused is the fact that while pricing is aggressive, both players seem to have very limited capacity to start with. We hence believe that this is likely to be introductory pricing and unlikely to be sustainable in the long run for the features/brands on offer. Nevertheless, RE would be forced to reconsider its pricing/brand strategy very quickly, which will in turn drive margin pressure. Outlook Accordingly, we have now lowered our earnings estimates by 16-18% over FY24-25E as we revisit our growth and margin estimates. As a result, our TP is reduced to INR 3,086 per share (from INR 3,715 per share earlier). We expect RE to be in a much better position to fight back once this competitive pricing stabilizes.

Outlook We maintain our Buy rating on Eicher Motors Limited (EML) with a revised PT of Rs. 3,855, led by increasing premiumisation in the domestic market, expectation of healthy traction in exports, and rise in non-auto income.

For EIM, structural domestic franchise revival (with the response to Hunter distinguishing EIM as a serial winner and given the slew of other planned launches) and ramp-up in exports (post many years of seeding), along with better mix and softer commodity prices would drive ~25% FY23-25E EPS CAGR (refer our recent 2W note).  Outlook We upgrade FY24E EPS by ~11% and retain BUY, with ~18% upside; our SOTP-based TP at Rs4,000/sh (Rs3,590 earlier) is based on 25x PER/20x PER for the motorcycle/CV business, on FY25 estimates.

Eicher Motors&rsquo; (EIM) 4QFY23 consolidated EBITDA margin at 24.5% came above BBG consensus (24%) but missed PLe (25.1%); margins expaned 150bps QoQ given (1) higher-than-expected ASPs on better mix, (2) lower commodity prices and (3) price hikes; despite de-inventorisation impact. Royal Enfield (RE) was an exception in auto space and didn&rsquo;t see weakness on rural side. RE has planned multiple product launches over next 2 years, which should aid volume growth. On the CV side, VECV should benefit from continued growth in the CV industry. EIM remains our preferred pick in the 2W space as we anticipate (1) volume growth from new product launches, (2) higher export revenue mix, (3) increase in mix of spares and merchandise revenue to aid both revenue growth and margin expansion.

Management sees stable demand in the domestic market and expects the next phase of growth to come from the ramp-up of Hunter in tier-3 and smaller cities. While EIM is witnessing a seasonal decline in export markets, it expects growth to be driven by the ramp-up in the portfolio and its reach in international markets. EIM will continue to launch new products to address demand in international markets and to give upgrade options to RE owners in India. Although the focus remains on profit growth over profitability, we believe there are levers for margin improvement in the near term.  Outlook  The stock trades at 21.7x/17.2x FY24E/FY25E consolidated EPS. We have a BUY rating on the stock with a TP of INR3,625 (Mar&rsquo;25E SoTP).

This was largely due to ~4% miss in EBITDA of S/A performance as 1) ASP came in lower at Rs162.2k/unit(est Rs166.8k/unit) and 2) S/A gross margins came in lower at 41.7% (est 42.2%) led by product mix and delayed impact of product price hike (price protection for Hunter). EIM&rsquo;s margins expansion to be gradual as impact of weaker product mix (increasing contribution from Hunter) to partially offset by 1) price hikes of ~1.5% for Hunter in Nov&rsquo;22, 2) + operating leverage due to higher volumes and 3) increased share of exports as Hunter has been launched in exportsmarkets. We cut FY24/25 consol EPS by 3%/3.7% to factor in for weaker mix related gross margins contraction and lower ASPs. After witnessing severe headwinds over last 24‐30 months, we expect volumes to grow ~21% CAGR over FY22‐25E (v/s ‐7% CAGR in FY20‐22). Recent launches could be an inflection point for RE as a completely new and improved platform could drive a revival. VECV would see a cyclical recovery in volume and profit, in turn boosting consolidated PAT CAGR to 21% over FY23‐25E. Stock trades at 23.5x/20.2x FY24E/FY25E consol EPS.  Outlook We maintain BUY with SoTP based revised TP of Rs3,942 (v/s Rs4,094). We value S/A business at 25x (~15% discount to 10yr LPA). EIM is one of our preferred picks from 2W OEM space.
