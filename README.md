# Bankruptcy Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting bankruptcy using machine learning techniques. Bankruptcy prediction is an important task in financial analysis, helping businesses assess the financial health and stability of companies.

## Dataset
The bankruptcy prediction model is trained on a dataset sourced from [provide source]. The dataset includes [describe features] and underwent preprocessing steps such as [mention preprocessing steps].

## Methodology
The bankruptcy prediction model utilizes [mention algorithm or approach] for classification. The model building process involves feature selection, model selection, and evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
The results of the bankruptcy prediction model are as follows:
- Accuracy: [provide accuracy score]
- Precision: [provide precision score]
- Recall: [provide recall score]
- F1 Score: [provide F1 score]
